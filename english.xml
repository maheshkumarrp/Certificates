Desmond Boylan, File AP Photo FILE - In this Aug. 14, 2015, file photo, a U.S. flag flies at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba. U.S. investigators are chasing many theories about what’s harming American diplomats in Cuba, including a sonic attack, electromagnetic weapon or flawed spying device. Desmond Boylan, File AP Photo Top US diplomat says closing embassy in Cuba &apos;under review&apos; By JOSH LEDERMAN Associated Press September 17, 2017 5:06 PM NEW YORK 
The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday. 
Tillerson&apos;s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after a half-century of estrangement. 
&quot;We have it under evaluation,&quot; Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. &quot;It&apos;s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We&apos;ve brought some of those people home. It&apos;s under review.&quot; 
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims — diplomats and their families — some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported . 
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential &quot;sonic attack.&quot; Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. 
Tillerson once called the events &quot;health attacks,&quot; but the State Department has since used the term &quot;incidents&quot; while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn&apos;t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it&apos;s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter. 
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected. 
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn&apos;t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. 
A decision to shutter the embassy, even temporarily, would deal a demoralizing blow to the delicate detente that President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro announced in late 2014. The next year, embassies were reopened and restrictions on travel and commerce eased — signs of a warming relationship that displeased some hard-liners in Cuba&apos;s government. President Donald Trump has reversed some of the changes, but left many in place. 
Tillerson spoke on CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week. 
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it&apos;s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit. 
The U.S. hasn&apos;t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn&apos;t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba&apos;s security services might be involved. 
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States — a move with dramatic diplomatic implications 
&quot;Cuba&apos;s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,&quot; said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who led the effort, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American and critic of the U.S. detente. 
The incidents have frightened Havana&apos;s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.  </text>

      <title>Trump or Hillary. Which is worse?</title>
      <text>Donald Trump has retweeted a GIF that shows him swinging a golf club and hitting Hillary, and I interrupted my submission to the Austrian Fo Min to wonder which of them is worse. Really. Which of that pair is worse? 
Trump’s GIF image splices together footage of him taking a swing on a golf course with footage of Clinton falling as she boards an air plane. The footage is edited and altered to make it appear as though Clinton is hit in the back with golf ball streaking by as a white blurr to make her trip and fall over. 
First off, hitting anyone in the back is an act of cowardice, even if it is a very vile Hillary. But it seems, it is precisely this kind of cowardly act that pyschos like Trump, who dodged military service in Vietnam, as well as like Hillary, who stood down the security at Benghazi to allow the US ambassador to be killed, revel in and celebrate. 
Second, only a thug can think that a six foot three male hitting a small, and slight woman, even evil Hillary, in the back with a golf ball is in anyway cool. 
Third, Trump’s golf swing lacks grace. Sorry, but an “amazing” golf swing should follow a perfect arc as the left knee bends and the upper body swivels in perfect coordination. The ball should be struck with the appearance of effortless ease while Trump looks like a terrier dog aggressively attacking it. It should be hit at the perfect angle with maximum power to send it in the exact direction desired. The look should be wide. Not even his blue jacket can hide Trump’s lack of grace. He looks like a terrier with a long stick. After whacking the ball as hard as he can, he looks what the effect is with a narrow focus. 
My mother won a medal at her university in Ireland for golf. Her follow up shots, chips and putts etc, were not so good. But her swing made up for it. It was so superb, people would catch their breadth. 
Get into the flow, Don. Get into the flow of goodness, kindness, of care for others. Get into the flow of intuition, into the flow which carries golf and the universe, and in a positive direction. Golf is not about Me, Me, Me, aggression and control. Golf is about letting go and letting intuition flow. </text>

      <title>Tillerson says U.S. could stay in Paris climate accord</title>
      <text>September 17, 2017 / 2:55 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Tillerson says U.S. could stay in Paris climate accord Lucia Mutikani 4 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States could remain in the Paris climate accord under the right conditions, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday, signalling a shift in tone from the Trump administration, which angered allies with its decision to pull out of the agreement. President Donald Trump is willing to work with partners in the Paris agreement if the United States could construct a set of terms that are fair and balanced for Americans, Tillerson said on the CBS’“Face The Nation.” Asked if there was a chance the United States could stay in the accord, Tillerson responded, “I think under the right conditions.” “The president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,” Tillerson said. Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, struck a similar tone in television interviews on Sunday in which he said Trump had always been willing to consider changes on the climate pact. “He left the door open to re-entering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States,” said McMaster said on ABC’s “This Week” programme. “If there’s an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly.” The accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The Republican president fulfilled his campaign promise to pull out of the 2015 accord in June, when he announced tersely “We’re getting out.” Trump maintained the pact would undermine the U.S. economy and national sovereignty and his decision drew anger and condemnation from world leaders.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo It takes four years for a country to withdraw from the Paris agreement, so the United States will be a party to the agreement until two days after Trump’s first term ends. U.S. officials attended a meeting on Saturday of ministers from more than 30 of the nations that signed the climate change agreement. The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Trump administration officials said the United States would not pull out of the agreement and had offered to re-engage in the deal. McMaster dismissed the report as inaccurate. “He’s out of the Paris climate accord,”he told the “Fox News Sunday” programme. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a news conference at Lancaster house in London, Britain, September 14, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay Tillerson said Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser, was overseeing the issue. “So I think the plan is for director Cohn to consider other ways in which we can work with partners in the Paris Climate Accord. We want to be productive. We want to be helpful,” said. Cohn has been part of the “stay-in” accord camp, which included Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Former chief strategist Steve Bannon was one of the main opponents of the accord before leaving the White House last month. Trump has said the Paris accord is soft on leading polluters like China and India, putting U.S. industry at risk. But the Republican president has shown flexibility on some campaign promises, and U.S. allies have been vocal on the importance of the climate accord. At a July news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, Trump held open the door to a reversal of his decision, saying “Something could happen with respect to the Paris accords. Let’s see what happens.” Additional reporting by Valerie Volcovici; Writing by Lucia Mutikani and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe</text>

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 21 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images Originally published on September 17, 2017 1:02 pm 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.  </text>

Wonder when Donald Trump visit Florida to inspect the destruction cause by Hurricane Irma, will he :- 
(1) Make a statement that he make a big mistake for calling Global Warming a hoax. 
(2) Make a statement that he make a big mistake of pulling out from the Paris Climate Agreement - and will reconsider rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement.

Nature of karma will see Donald Trump and his supporters really repent - on all those wrong views that he and his supporters expounded on Global Warming, Protectionism on trade, business and investment plus others.

Donald Trump should take the initiative to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord - and not wait for others to beg him to join.

Because karma is not going to wait.

WASHINGTON: The United States could remain in the Paris climate accord under the right conditions, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday.
President Donald Trump was willing to work with partners in the Paris agreement if the United States could construct a set of terms that are fair and balanced for Americans, Tillerson said on the CBS &quot;Face The Nation&quot; programme.
&quot;The president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,&quot; Tillerson said.
Trump administration officials said the United States would not pull out of the agreement and had offered to re-engage in the deal, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. U.S. officials attended a meeting on Saturday of ministers from more than 30 of the nations that signed the climate-change agreement.
Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the United States from the 2015 global climate pact, arguing it would undermine the U.S. economy and national sovereignty. The decision drew anger and condemnation from world leaders.
Tillerson said Gary Cohn, Trump&apos;s top economic adviser, was overseeing the issue.
&quot;So I think the plan is for director Cohn to consider other ways in which we can work with partners in the Paris Climate Accord. We want to be productive. We want to be helpful,&quot; said.
Similar sentiments were expressed on Sunday by national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who said on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; programme that Trump was open to &quot;any discussions that will help us improve the environment.&quot;
&quot;He left the door open to re-entering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States,&quot; said McMaster. &quot;If there&apos;s an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly.&quot;
The accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.

Hurricane Maria heading for Caribbean: US forecasters

WASHINGTON: Maria became a hurricane on Sunday (Sep 17) as it barrelled toward the storm-staggered eastern Caribbean with 120 kilometres per hour winds, the US National Hurricane Centre said, on a path similar to that of mega storm Irma earlier in the month.
Storm warnings and watches went up in many of the Caribbean islands still reeling from Irma&apos;s destructive passage.
As of 2100 GMT, Maria was a Category One hurricane, the lowest on the five point Saffir-Simpson scale, located 225 kilometres northeast of Barbados while bearing west-northwest at 24 kilometres an hour, the NHC said.
&quot;On the forecast track, the centre of Maria will move across the Leeward Islands on Monday night and then over the extreme northeastern Caribbean Sea on Tuesday,&quot; it said.
Hurricane warnings were triggered for Guadeloupe, Dominica, St Kitts, Nevis and Montserrat.
Less urgent &apos;watches&apos; were issued for the US and British Virgin Islands where at least nine people were killed during Irma; French-Dutch island St Martin where 15 people died; Saba and St Eustatius; St Barthelemy and Anguilla.
A warning is typically issued 36 hours before the first occurrence of tropical storm-force winds while watches are issued 48 hours in advance.
In the French territory of Guadeloupe, authorities announced a &quot;red alert&quot; from Monday with schools, businesses and government offices ordered closed as officials predicted severe flooding in the lower parts of the island and urged people living there to move to higher ground.
An official statement predicted wind speeds could pick up to between 150 kilometres to 180 kilometres per hour, which under the Saffir-Simpson scale would elevate the storm to either Category Two or Three.
Tropical storm warnings were meanwhile in place in Martinique, Antigua and Barbuda, Saba and St Eustatius, and St Lucia. The tiny island of Barbuda was decimated by Hurricane Irma Sep 5-6 when it made its first landfall in the Caribbean as a top intensity Category Five storm.
DANGEROUS STORM SURGES 
The NHC said Maria could produce a &quot;dangerous storm surge accompanied by large and destructive waves&quot; that will raise water levels by 1.2 to 1.8 metres when it passes through the Leeward Islands.
It also forecast a maximum potential rainfall of 51 centimetres in the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico and the US and British Virgin Islands through Wednesday night - conditions that could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.
A second hurricane, Jose, is also currently active in the Atlantic and has triggered tropical storm watches for the northeastern United States.
Irma left around 40 people dead in the Caribbean before churning east and pounding Florida, where at least 20 people were killed.
France, Britain and the Netherlands have been criticized for the pace of relief efforts in their overseas territories amid widespread shortages of food, water and electricity.
Hurricane Irma broke weather records when it sustained winds of 295 kilometres per hour for more than 33 hours.
Many scientists are convinced that mega storms such as Irma and Harvey before it are intensified by the greater energy they can draw from oceans that a warming as a result of global climate change.  Source: AFP/de

      <title>Host Colbert to unleash Trump onslaught...</title>
      <text>Stars arrive for Emmys expected to feature a cheeky Colbert By LYNN ELBER https://apnews.com/281ecc068b704cf5a424d41e089a8e02 Link copied! 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — &quot;This Is Us&quot; stars Sterling K. Brown and Ron Cephas Jones were among the Emmy Awards nominees playing it cool as they arrived for Sunday&apos;s ceremony. 
The actors paused for photographs and interviews on the red carpet, which for the first time was tented and air conditioned to provide relief from the usually warm September weather in Los Angeles. Nature provided a break as well, with temperatures in the 70s. 
Brown won an Emmy last year for playing O.J. Simpson prosecutor Christopher Darden in the limited series &quot;People v O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story,&quot; and this time is up for best drama actor for the NBC drama. 
&quot;It does feel different but for different reasons. I&apos;m the first African-American in 16 years nominated. That kind of blows my mind,&quot; he said. 
Andre Braugher, who was the last black actor to get a nod in the category, for &quot;Gideon&apos;s Crossing&quot; in 2001, also was the last one to claim top drama performance honors, for &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot; in 1998. 
Another &quot;This Is Us&quot; star, Chris Sullivan, made a fashion statement with a top hat, cane and purple bow tie. He wasn&apos;t alone in going for a bold look — Jeremy Maguire from &quot;Modern Family&quot; vamped in a purple cape — while Tessa Thompson and Issa Rae dazzled with sophisticated, brightly colored gowns. 
Jackie Hoffman, nominated for the FX series &quot;Feud: Bette and Joan&quot; said she&apos;s &quot;less freak-out nervous&quot; now that all the pre-Emmy festivities are over and she&apos;s finally at the big show. 
The 69th prime-time Emmy ceremony will be about winners and losers and more, including politics and a cheeky turn by host Stephen Colbert. 
Colbert, whose &quot;Late Show&quot; is a regular forum on the Trump administration, said that the president is fair game during the awards show airing at 8 p.m. EDT on CBS. 
The Emmys are a celebration of TV, &quot;and the biggest television star of the last year was Donald Trump,&quot; Colbert said at last week&apos;s ceremonial red-carpet rollout outside Los Angeles&apos; Microsoft Theater. He&apos;s also claimed that his nude rear — or part of it, suitably tanned — will be included in the opening musical number. 
How will winners and presenters approach the evening? Will they weigh in with political jokes or speeches, or could the recent devastating hurricanes that ravaged parts of Texas and Florida prompt moments that avoid divisiveness, at least for the show&apos;s three or so hours? 
The honors themselves could make a statement. In the drama category, the nominees include polar opposites &quot;This Is Us,&quot; a heartfelt family drama, and the dystopian &quot;The Handmaid&apos;s Tale,&quot; which some observers have called a reflection of our time. 
A victory by NBC&apos;s &quot;This Is Us,&quot; the first network drama series to be nominated since CBS&apos; &quot;The Good Wife&quot; in 2011, would prove that broadcasters can compete with the more adventurous premium cable and streaming platforms that target niche audiences. No network series has won in the category since &quot;24&quot; in 2006. 
With previous two-time winner &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; absent because it fell outside the eligibility window, &quot;This Is Us&quot; and &quot;The Handmaid&apos;s Tale&quot; are among an unprecedented number of newcomers that include &quot;The Crown,&quot; &apos;&apos;Stranger Things&quot; and &quot;Westworld.&quot; Repeat contenders &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; and &quot;House of Cards&quot; round out the field. 
Among comedy nominees, the political satire &quot;Veep&quot; is a favored again after two consecutive wins, and its star Julia Louis-Dreyfus is considered equally if not more likely to claim the best comedy actress trophy for the sixth time for her role. Combined with Emmys she&apos;s won for &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;New Adventures of Old Christine,&quot; that would tie her with Cloris Leachman as the most-winning Emmy performer ever. 
&quot;Veep&quot; is competing with &quot;Atlanta&quot;; &quot;black-ish,&quot;; &quot;Master of None&quot;; &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;; &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot; and &quot;Modern Family,&quot; which, with five previous wins in the category, is tied with &quot;Frasier&quot; for most top-series awards ever. 
It could be a big night for African-American performers. There are a record 12 black actors competing for lead or supporting honors in continuing comedy and drama series, including &quot;Atlanta&quot; creator and star Donald Glover. But no Latinos and only one Asian-American — &quot;Master of None&quot; star and co-creator Aziz Ansari — were nominated.

      <title>5 Stories to Follow for UN Week</title>
      <text>5 Stories to Follow for UN Week September 17, 2017 General Every UNGA has its sideshows. In past years, this has included things like Muammar Gaddafi’s rambling 125 minute speech ; Hugo Chavez suggesting George W. Bush was l iterally the devil , or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claiming there are no gays in Iran . These antics tend to suck up much of the media attention, often to the detriment of important issues of substance. This year, though, the sideshow is the main event: Donald Trump’s debut at the United Nations. Trump will spend a good amount of time at UNGA. He scrapped plans to reside an hour drive away at his golf club in New Jersey and will instead stay in downtown Manhattan, blocks from the UN. On Monday he will preside over a UN high level meeting on UN reform and on Tuesday he will deliver his much anticipated address to General Assembly. Beyond that, he will have a number of bilateral meetings with other heads of state and dignitaries, including UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, whom he had not yet met in person as president. This is a fairly typical schedule for any American president, and in a press conference ahead of UNGA UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and National Security Advisor HR McMaster laid out an agenda that is not terribly dissimilar from previous Presidential engagements at the UN. Still, Donald Trump is not a typical US president. The key question on everyone’s mind is: which Donald Trump will show up? Will be be scripted and stay on message? And if so, what will that message be? Will he say one thing at the UN and tweet something else? The inability of the international community to accurately predict the behavior of the United States president has been a driving force of international relations since Trump took office in January. This dynamic will surely manifest itself at the United Nations this week, with Trump’s erraticism keeping the UN at edge. Though it does not register on the Trump administration’s agenda, much of the international community are using UNGA as an opportunity to spur progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Wi th the US federal government abrogating its leadership role on climate change and sustainable development, many other forces are stepping up to fill the void. Throughout New York this week, there are innumerable opportunities for local government, civil society, the private sector and philanthropies to demonstrate leadership on smart growth and sustainable development. These include several high level meetings at the United Nations and events around New York, including (but certainly not limited to) the annual Social Good Summit, the Global Citizen Festival, Climate Week, the Sustainable Development Solutions Summit at Columbia University, and a new forum organized by the Gates Foundation, called “Goal Keepers” that will feature a keynote from Barack Obama. The Sustainable Development Goals are a set of 16 goals that every UN member state pledged to work to achieve by 2030. The top line goal is a total elimination of extreme poverty — as defined as people who live on less than $1.25 per day — by 2030. Now two years into those goals, a great deal of effort and energy is being expended into devising tangible solutions to some of the discrete challenges posed by the goals. The dialogue around the SDGs this year will very much be solutions-driven, including devising new ways to finance the SDGs, exploring new strategies to curb maternal mortality, or scaling up strategies that already have a proven track record. T hose these events and meetings are not likely to generate much media attention, but they are arguably the important and substantive outcomes of this week in New York. International crises have often provided a sobering backdrop against which world leaders convene in New York. Alas, this year is no different. Over 400,0000 members of an ethnic minority in Myanmar, the Rohingya, have been driven from their homes and fled across the border to Bangladesh. The uptick in violence began in late August and since then Rohingya towns, villages and neighborhoods have been burned to the ground by government security forces. Even as it foments a mass displacement crisis, the government of Myanmar is preventing aid from reaching this besieged population. Top UN officials, including the Secretary General himself, have called a campaign of ethnic cleansing. Behind the scenes, diplomats will focus on twin priorities of designing strategies to pressure Burma to relent on its ongoing campaign and boosting financial support to Bangladesh and humanitarian relief agencies working to stem the fallout. From the General Assembly rostrum expect a diversity of dignitaries to condemn this ongoing human rights catastrophe. The Rohingya are religiously muslim, and their plight has become increasingly politically relevant in Muslim majority countries. European countries are also likely to publicly criticize the Burmese government, as they have been growing increasingly condemnatory in recent days. One big unknown is whether Donald Trump will raise the issue publicly. Any other US president probably would, but he has shown a public indifference to human rights issues in general and an antipathy towards Muslims in particular. No leader, though, will be able to criticize the country’s de-facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to her face. The Nobel Laureate has decided to skip UNGA. Meanwhile, by the time her counterpart across the border Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hassana takes the General Assembly podium on TK, the number of Rohingya refugees who have fled her county in the last three weeks could very well exceed half a million. UNGA convenes on the heels of yet another tit-for-tat between North Korea and the Security Council. After North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on September 6, the Security Council imposed a heavy round of new sanctions on the country. These came on top of particularly stringent sanctions passed just one month earlier. Meanwhile, last week, the North once again tested a missile, which flew over Japanese territory. On Friday, the Security Council issued a joint statement condemning this latest provocation. Little progress is expected on this issue this week, principally for the fact that the Chinese President is skipping UNGA. Still, North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho is in town — and he has historically been a key interlocutor with the United States. The chances that he meet with his American counterpart Rex Tillerson, however, are rather slim. Expect American diplomats —and President Trump himself — to press counterparts to more robustly enforce the recently-passed Security Council sanctions. Taken together, these sanctions, which hit North Korea’s textile industry, coal, oil and seafood exports, affect about a third of North Korea’s foreign trade. But they are only as strong as they are enforced. Encouraging countries to put the squeeze on North Korea by swiftly implementing the sanctions is very much expected to be a centerpiece of President Trump’s address to the General Assembly. The alternative, he is expected to argue, increases the likelihood of war. Though he came to office having expressed disdain for the United Nations, President Trump has nevertheless put the UN at the center of resolving the most urgent national security threat facing the United States. Donald Trump’s debut at the United Nations comes one day before his speech to the General Assembly. On Monday, Trump is playing host to a high level meeting on United Nations reform. He is there to lend his support— and demonstrate the highest level of US government commitment — to a rather technical set of management and bureaucratic reforms that are being championed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. This is likely to be the substantive highlight of American engagement at the UN, and it accompanies a “political declaration” of support around some key principles of UN management reform. On the one hand, it is somewhat curious that President Trump would personally lead a forum on this effort because these discussions center on rather arcane peculiarities about the UN bureaucracy. (To whit: the hot debate is whether or not UN “Resident Coordinators” should report to the Administrator of the UN Development Program or directly to Office of the Secretary General. Another issue: should the Assistant-Secretary-General for Economic Development also serve under a newly formed position of United Nations Chief Economist?) On the other hand, resolving questions like these–and many, many others — are actually quite critical to a better functioning UN system. The reform package championed by Antonio Guterres and vigorously supported by Nikki Haley would make the United Nations a more streamlined bureaucracy better able to deliver tangible results to the people it serves. So it should be seen as a net plus that the US has decided to positively engage on these issues at the highest level. From a political standpoint, the net effect of these reforms would be to strengthen the position of the UN Secretary General–that is, give him more power to hire and fire personnel and more generally shape the UN bureaucracy. Efforts to empower the office of the Secretary General have historically been supported by the United States, Europe, Japan and the major donor countries. They have been resisted by the global south, which tends to view these efforts as a constraint upon their ability to influence hiring quotas and spending decisions. Whether or not this high level forum provides the kind of political boost these efforts need to win support from the broader UN membership is not yet clear. But it is definitely a positive sign that the United States is willing to give it a try.

      <title>Top US diplomat says closing Embassy in Cuba ‘under review’</title>
      <text>by Josh Lederman, The Associated Press Posted Sep 17, 2017 11:14   12:00 pm EDT 
NEW YORK, N.Y. – The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday. 
Tillerson’s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after roughly a half-century of estrangement. 
“We have it under evaluation,” Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. “It’s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We’ve brought some of those people home. It’s under review.” 
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported. 
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential “sonic attack.” Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. 
Tillerson once called the events “health attacks,” but the State Department has since used the term “incidents” while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn’t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it’s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter. 
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected. 
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. 
Tillerson spoke on CBS’“Face the Nation” as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week. 
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it’s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit. 
The U.S. hasn’t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn’t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba’s security services might be involved. 
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States — a move with dramatic diplomatic implications 
“Cuba’s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,” said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas. 
The incidents have frightened Havana’s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 19 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images Originally published on September 17, 2017 4:02 pm 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. © 2017 South Carolina Public Radio</text>

      <title>The Media Effect</title>
      <text>


Oh, no! Not another word cloud!

I&apos;ve said the same, but an understanding of what happened- and of What Happened - is impossible without it.  It&apos;s not sufficient- but it is necessary.

And the reviews of Hillary Clinton&apos;s &quot;What Happened&quot; have been very negative from people who didn&apos;t read it, and especially prior to its availability. One Democratic US Representative commented &quot;it is difficult for some of us, even like myself who’ve supported her, to play out all these media cycles about the blame game, and the excuses.” And he was reportedly a Clinton  supporter. 

 &quot;A top Democratic donor&quot; remarked &quot;I think she should just zip it, but she’s not going to.&quot;  A &quot;Clinton critic&quot; charged “She’s doing harm to all of us because of her own selfishness. Honestly, I wish she’d just shut the f**k up and go away.”

Because, presumably, if she would simply stifle herself, all discussion of the 2016 election would simply vanish. Donald Trump would stop reminding us and the media would go on to do investigative reports about tax and regulatory policy, infrastructure needs and the nuclear triad.

Conveniently, contributors to FiveThirtyEight recently chatted among themselves about the media reaction to Clinton&apos;s campaign memoir, as well as the factors she pointed to in her defeat.

Although the group noted that the percentage of negative to positive news was identical for the two major candidates, Nate Silver observed

.... the fact that the media spent so much time focusing on Trump made it hard for anyone to focus on any one aspect of Trump’s behavior. 

As you can see from the Gallup charts I posted earlier, people had lots of different feelings about Trump and heard lots of different negative stories about him. But none of them as persistently as Clinton and trust and emails. 

One of those was Gallup&apos;s word cloud of what people said and/or heard about from 7/11/16-0/18/16:





Even though most reports about Trump (as well as Clinton) were negative, the coverage was skewed against the Democrat. Perry Bacon explained

my suspicion is that a lot of the bad coverage came from a desire to find a way to balance the sharp coverage of Trump with coverage that was negative about Clinton. The both-sides model of political journalism left you with 15 Trump scandals and 1 Clinton scandal, so you have to pump up the Clinton scandal/controversy/whatever to make up for that big gap since all of these outlets are obsessed with attacks from the right. 

Although the four participants disagreed on how much weight they&apos;d ascribe to each of the causes, they conceded &quot;most of these were real factors in Trump winning and Clinton losing. That is a lesson likely to get lost when, as Christina Cauterucci wrote , &quot;Early reviews take issue with the book’s right to exist as much as the quality of its contents. &quot; Share | </text>

      <title>Trump Heading To United Nations</title>

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: 
President Trump&apos;s talks with Democratic leaders on immigration have left much of the political class perplexed and his ardent followers incensed. But what does this outbreak of bipartisanship actually mean? He&apos;s been giving his usual mixed messages on Twitter. To get some clarity, we&apos;re joined now by senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Good morning. 
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning. 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Mara, Trump is dealing with the Democrats. Just a couple of weeks ago, it was over the debt ceiling and hurricane relief - this time DACA and funding for border security but with no money for a border wall, we should say. What does this mean for the president&apos;s relationship with his own party, though? 
LIASSON: That&apos;s a good question, and Republicans are wondering about that, too. As you said, they were blindsided by this tentative deal he made on DACA with Democrats. It really shook up a lot of Republicans not so much because they disagree with the content of it. But they&apos;re not sure if they can count on President Trump. And they&apos;re wondering where else he&apos;s willing to make deals with Democrats. It clearly shows that he is frustrated with the leaders of his own party and their failure to deliver, as promised, on issues like repealing and replacing Obamacare. 
He does seem more comfortable making deals with his fellow New Yorker Chuck Schumer than he does Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan. But Republicans in Congress almost shrugged this off this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, in his own dry way, we look forward to seeing the president&apos;s own legislative proposal. But this also does seem to be the first time in this tentative deal on the DREAMers that Donald Trump did something that could possibly alienate his base. 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, that&apos;s a good point. I mean, what about his base? We have seen some reaction to this. What has it been? 
LIASSON: This is splitting his base. Polls show that most Americans are sympathetic to the DREAMers. Majorities favor letting them stay, even large numbers of Republicans, but not the president&apos;s hardcore base. And we saw this week on Twitter some Trump supporters burning their Make America Great Again hats. We saw the headlines in Breitbart, the &quot;alt-right&quot; website run by his former political adviser, Steve Bannon. The headline said &quot;Amnesty Don.&quot; We&apos;re now going to find out how much of his base is what I call the Fifth Avenue voters, people who will stick with him no matter what. You know, he famously said, I could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and not lose any voters. 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Right. 
LIASSON: So there is a bit of a cult of personality around him. But there are other parts of his base who feel deeply about immigration. This was the signature issue in his campaign. And the question is, will they become disenchanted and maybe don&apos;t - stay home - not turn out to vote for Republicans in 2018? 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: He&apos;s got to be looking closely at that. I want to move to the - though, to the Russia probe. We haven&apos;t been hearing much about that lately. But the special counsel, Robert Mueller, took a step that may turn out to be a very big deal. 
LIASSON: Yes, what he did - he executed a search warrant to obtain ads bought by Russians that ran on Facebook during the campaign. He wants to know how those ads were targeted to just the right voters - just the right Facebook feeds. He wants to know what Russia - if what Russia did using America social media violated the laws against foreigners making campaign contributions. He wants to know if Russia got any targeting help for these ads from the Trump campaign. This was the fake news, the kind of anti-Hillary Clinton propaganda that Russia pushed during the campaign. And in a broader sense - Facebook, Google, Twitter - all the huge, giant, global social media publishers basically are increasingly in the crosshairs of Congress because they&apos;re looking at these giant publishers, and they&apos;re starting to look a lot more like giant, unregulated utilities. 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: We&apos;ve been focused on what transpired between the president and the Democratic Party and also the Russia probe and hurricanes. But there have been events overseas as well. 
LIASSON: Yes there have. North Korea fired another missile, once again calling the president&apos;s bluff. He&apos;s threatened them with fire and fury. He said the U.S. military was locked and loaded if they continued their provocations. That hasn&apos;t stopped them. And once again, the president seemed to disclose classified information from another country, this time after the latest terrorist attack in London. He said that Scotland Yard had the terrorists in their sights before the bombing. It&apos;s not clear whether he heard that on &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; or from a classified briefing, but that earned him a stern rebuke from the British government. And it might come up again when he goes to the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week. 
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Mara Liasson, our senior political correspondent. Thanks so much. 
LIASSON: Thank you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2017 South Carolina Public Radio</text>

      <title>Tillerson says closing Embassy in Cuba ‘under review’</title>
      <text>Updated September 17, 2017 6:05am 
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
A U.S. flag flies at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba. U.S. investigators are chasing many theories about what’s harming American diplomats in Cuba, including a sonic attack, electromagnetic weapon or flawed spying device. 
NEW YORK &gt;&gt; The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today. 
Tillerson’s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after roughly a half-century of estrangement. 
“We have it under evaluation,” Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. “It’s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We’ve brought some of those people home. It’s under review.” 
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported. 
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential “sonic attack.” Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. 
Tillerson once called the events “health attacks,” but the State Department has since used the term “incidents” while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn’t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it’s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter. 
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected. 
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. 
Tillerson spoke on CBS’“Face the Nation” as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week. 
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it’s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit. 
The U.S. hasn’t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn’t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba’s security services might be involved. 
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States — a move with dramatic diplomatic implications 
“Cuba’s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,” said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas. 
The incidents have frightened Havana’s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.  </text>

      <title>&apos;No Kidding&apos;; Sanders Refutes Clinton&apos;s Criticism of Him</title>
      <text>Responding to interview questions; Judi Dench, Ali Fazal, Eddie Izzard and Stephen Frears. Sanders Pushes Back Against Clinton&apos;s Criticism “People say not everybody who voted for Bernie ended up voting for Hillary, no kidding!&quot; Sanders said on &quot;Meet The Press&quot; Receive the latest politics updates in your inbox Email Privacy policy | More Newsletters John Minchillo/AP File Photo—Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during a &quot;Care Not Cuts&quot; rally in support of the Affordable Care Act, July 9, 2017, in Covington, Ky. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday pushed back against criticism from Hillary Clinton that he did not do enough to bring his supporters to her in the 2016 general election, NBC News reported. Sanders chalked up the fact that some of his supporters during 2016’s Democratic primaries eventually voted for Donald Trump in the general election to “the nature of politics.” “People say not everybody who voted for Bernie ended up voting for Hillary, no kidding!&quot; Sanders said on &quot;Meet The Press.&quot; He added, &quot;That&apos;s what happens in politics.&quot; Speech to UN General Assembly Anchoring Trump&apos;s Week The Vermont senator was responding to criticism that Clinton leveled at him in her new book and in recent media appearances that he didn’t do enough to bring his supporters to her side after their contentious Democratic primary for president last year.</text>

      <title>Rex Tillerson: US considering closing Havana embassy</title>
      <text>Tillerson: US may close Havana embassy 01:56 Story highlights Tillerson called the mysterious attacks &apos;a very serious issue&apos; He and McMaster reiterated the US would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement Washington (CNN) US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday that the US was considering closing its embassy in Havana, Cuba. &quot;We have it under evaluation,&quot; Tillerson said on CBS&apos;s &quot;Face the Nation.&quot; A group of five Republican senators wrote to Tillerson, requesting the US declare Cuban diplomats unwelcome and shutter the embassy in Cuba, which the US opened near the end of former President Barack Obama&apos;s second term. US government officials have said State Department employees in the Havana embassy were subject to mysterious &quot;acoustic&quot; attacks that led to serious health problems. Tillerson addressed the concern, but did not specify what would happen. Read More &quot;It&apos;s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered,&quot; Tillerson said. &quot;We&apos;ve brought some of those people home. It&apos;s under review.&quot; Obama eased the decades-long blockade on Cuba and sought to restore diplomatic ties between the two countries. After taking office, President Donald Trump said he was &quot;canceling&quot; the deal with Cuba and would return the US to a more adversarial posture with the island nation to spur it to do more to honor human rights. In June, Trump unveiled new restrictions on travel and business with Cuba. Before Trump&apos;s announcement, Tillerson said he believed Obama&apos;s approach had benefited the Cuban government without changing its behavior or the country&apos;s human rights situation. Paris climate accord The White House said Saturday the administration still intended to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement after a European official told reporters the US appeared to be softening its stance. Two of the Trump administration&apos;s top officials reiterated Sunday that Trump intended to withdraw from the agreement, unless the US could make changes to it. Tillerson, in his CBS interview, said National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was leading the administration&apos;s effort on the landmark agreement. &quot;Look, we are willing to work with partners in the Paris climate accord,&quot; Tillerson said of Trump&apos;s position. He said the United States&apos; voluntary commitment to the deal, which almost every other nation signed onto, was &quot;really out of balance&quot; relative to other economies. However, he said the US was willing and ready to stay in the deal if it established new terms. &quot;We want to be productive,&quot; Tillerson said, adding later, &quot;Under the right conditions, the President said he&apos;s open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others.&quot; Trump&apos;s national security adviser H.R. McMaster, speaking on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week,&quot; said the US would &quot;certainly&quot; stay in the deal if it got an agreement that benefited the US, but the administration&apos;s current stance was to exit the deal. &quot;What the President has said is that we are withdrawing from the Paris Accord,&quot; McMaster said. CNN&apos;s Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.</text>

      <title>North Korea escalation: What are the investment implications?</title>
      <text>Against the backdrop of an escalation of words between North Korea and President Trump , investors are scrambling to figure out what this means for their portfolios.
Should I hedge my portfolio by buying gold? Should I sell stocks? 
My response: Do nothing. 
Weeks like this are the perfect example of why you need a solid plan. Sticking to a plan, however, is not that easy. You need to be self-aware and accountable for it to work. Behavioral finance teaches us about loss aversion, which basically says that investors hate losses much more than they love gains. A 1979 study by Kahneman and Tversky found that a loss has about 2 times the impact of a gain of the same magnitude. It’s easy to say “if the market pulls back -10% I would invest more in the market.” But then the news of North Korea’s escalation comes out and the questions we receive are “the market is down -0.5% because of North Korea, should I sell some stocks or buy gold?”
The reality is that when the market gives you a 10% or 15% or 20% correction, most people will just freeze or panic sell. Mike Tyson can describe this phenomenon in a much cooler way than I can. When describing an opponent he said,
“They were talking about his style. ‘He’s going to give you a lot of lateral movement. He’s going to move, he’s going to dance. He’s going to do this, do that.’ I said, “Everybody has a plan until they get hit. Then…they stop in fear and freeze.” 
So a flimsy plan alone won’t work… it just won’t. So what IS the right strategy?
We at Zoe believe that there are a couple of rules that you must set before you EVER make any important investment decisions.
1) Understand why you are investing.
What is your goal? Is it to buy a house? Is it to invest towards your kids college? Is it to invest towards retirement? Is it for fun? Nothing wrong with investing a little bit of money for fun, I enjoy playing Blackjack once in awhile knowing that it won’t put my kids through college. 
2) Understand that time horizons matter.
Always always, assume that your timing when you buy or sell something is not going to be ideal (because it never quite feels ideal). If you are planning to use your savings in a year to buy a house, investing your savings in bitcoin might not be wise, since you have no control of what the market will deliver you in the next 12 months.
3) Understand your risk tolerance .
It is easy to say “I am going to invest for the long run.” Then you wake up one morning to find out that your 401k or brokerage account is down -12% in the last month and you freak out! Try to figure out how comfortable you would be with a -5%, -10%, -15%, -20% over the next 6 months. If you think you’ll scream uncle at -10% that matters. Because eventually, stocks WILL punch you in the mouth and deliver that -10% drop… is just a matter of time. The more you understand that and how comfortable you feel about it, the better chance you will have of not letting your emotions take over.

4) Formulate an investment plan of attack that you revisit regularly. 
Put it down in writing and tell your spouse or someone else about it so you feel a sense of accountability. Something like “Based on my risk tolerance and my medium and long term goals, I want to be invested 80% in stocks, 15% in bonds and have 5% in cash knowing that this portfolio will generate somewhere around 4–7% returns per year for the next decade.*”
Once you have the above in place you implement it yourself, you hire a robo-advisor or you hire a financial planner via Zoe ;) and you reevaluate numbers 1–3 from the list above, every 6 months to a year.
You may have noticed, North Korea didn’t come up once in any of the above rules. You know why? Because you have no clue what Donald Trump is going to tweet next and you definitely cannot control or predict how the markets are going to react to any of this mess.
It’s great to have a plan, but the market does not give a #@#@ about your plan. So that 80/15/5 initial portfolio from a few years back is now 90/8/2 after a huge stock bull market the last few years. In other words, the market has forced your portfolio out of line. So what do you do? You reevaluate your original goals every year and if they still are the same as before then you bring your portfolio back to the original allocation of 80/15/5. No emotion involved, no research necessary on what Kim Jong-un ate for breakfast this morning.
It’s not easy to stay disciplined in this approach on your own when you have a day job, a spouse and kids, which is why we launched Zoe . But even if you do decide to go it alone, do not make investment decisions because of North Korea or the Republican or Democratic party headlines. You can’t control any of it and whoever tells you they have an “edge” on any of these headlines is either 1) ignorant about how hard it is to actually have an “edge” 2) trying to sell you something or 3) Ray Dalio… who won’t manage your money.

      <title>Trump advisers warn North Korea to give up weapons programs</title>
      <text>Trump advisers warn North Korea to give up weapons programs DARLENE SUPERVILLE, Associated Press Published: September 17, 2017, 12:07 pm Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Sept. 15, 2017 file photo, President Donald Trump waves as he walks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington to Marine One for the short trip to Andrews Air Force Base, Md. Facing an escalating nuclear threat from North Korea and the mass flight of minority Muslims from Myanmar, world leaders gather at the United Nations starting Monday, Sept. 18 to tackle these and other tough challenges _ from the spread of terrorism to a warming planet. The spotlight will be on Trump and France’s new leader, Emmanuel Macron, who will both be making their first appearance at the General Assembly. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) 
SOMERSET, N.J. (AP) — Top advisers to President Donald Trump on Sunday warned North Korea to give up its missile and nuclear weapons programs and to quit making threats against the U.S. and its allies or face destruction. 
The warnings came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to continue the weapons programs, saying his country is nearing its goal of “equilibrium” in military force with the United States. They also come as world leaders begin arriving in New York for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly this week, where the topic of North Korea will be high on the agenda. 
Trump will be making his first appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, his biggest moment on the world stage since January’s inauguration. He is scheduled to address the world body, which he has criticized as weak and incompetent, on Tuesday. 
Trump tweeted Sunday that he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed North Korea during their latest telephone conversation on Saturday. Trump spoke with Moon from his New Jersey golf club, where aides said he spent the weekend preparing for his U.N. debut. 
U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Kim is “going to have to give up his nuclear weapons because the president has said he’s not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon.” 
Asked if that meant Trump would launch a military strike, McMaster said “he’s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.” 
Kim has threatened Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, and has fired two missiles over Japan, a U.S. ally in Asia, including one missile that was launched on Friday. North Korea also recently tested its most powerful bomb. 
The U.N. Security Council has voted unanimously twice in recent weeks to tighten economic sanctions on North Korea, including targeting shipments of oil and other fuel used in missile testing. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said North Korea was starting to “feel the pinch.” 
But she also warned of a tougher U.S. response in the future, saying the Security Council has “pretty much exhausted” all of its options and that she would be happy to turn the matter over to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis “because he has plenty of military options.” 
Mattis said earlier this month, after Kim tested a hydrogen bomb, that the U.S. will answer any threat from the North with a “massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming.” 
Trump has threatened to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea. Haley said that wasn’t an empty threat from the president but, when asked, she declined to describe the president’s intentions. 
“If North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed and we all know that and none of us want that,” Haley said. “None of us want war. But we also have to look at the fact that you are dealing with someone who is being reckless, irresponsible and is continuing to give threats not only to the United States, but to all their allies, so something is going to have to be done.” 
In Sunday’s tweet, Trump said he asked Moon about “Rocket Man” — an apparent reference to Kim. Trump also tweeted that long lines for gas are forming in North Korea and called it “too bad.” 
The White House said after Trump’s tweet that he and Moon are committed to strengthening deterrence and defense capabilities, and maximizing economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. 
Trump plans to sit down with Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the U.N. General Assembly session this week. 
Haley spoke on CNN’s “State of the Union” and McMaster appeared on ABC’s “This Week.” Share this: </text>

      <title>Donald Trump Hits Back At Hillary Clinton, With A Golf Ball, On Twitter</title>
      <text>News Alerts Donald Trump Hits Back At Hillary Clinton, With A Golf Ball, On Twitter Hillary Clinton had been back on the Republican president&apos;s Twitter feed in recent days as she promoted &quot;What Happened,&quot; her new book about the 2016 presidential election, with Trump resuming his campaign attack of &quot;Crooked Hillary.&quot; World | Reuters | Updated: September 17, 2017 21:26 IST 30 Shares COMMENTS Donald Trump had attacked Hillary Clinton directly last Wednesday in a pair of Twitter posts. WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday retweeted a doctored video of himself taking a golf swing and hitting former Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton, who then stumbles as she boards a plane.Clinton had been back on the Republican president&apos;s Twitter feed in recent days as she promoted &quot;What Happened,&quot; her new book about the 2016 presidential election, with Trump resuming his campaign attack of &quot;Crooked Hillary.&quot;The video, retweeted by several users, shows Trump on a golf course hitting a ball before segueing to the doctored shot of a golf ball hitting then-Secretary of State Clinton in the back as she is boarding a plane. The original video of Clinton, from 2011, does not show a golf ball.&quot;Donald Trump&apos;s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary,&quot; the tweet read.Trump attacked Clinton directly last Wednesday in a pair of Twitter posts.&quot;Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss,&quot; he said. &quot;She lost the debates and lost her direction! The &apos;deplorables&apos; came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!&quot;White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said later that day that Clinton was pushing &quot;false narratives&quot; in the book. Clinton admits mistakes during the campaign in the book but gives a harsh account of factors she believes led to Trump&apos;s victory, including alleged interference by Russia on his behalf and former FBI Director James Comey announcement that investigators were looking at a new trove of emails related to Clinton.Clinton, who has been giving a series of interviews promoting the book, responded to Trump&apos;s earlier criticism on Twitter with a suggestion that he read her earlier book, &quot;It Takes a Village,&quot; a picture book for children.A senior Democrat, US Representative Adam Schiff, said the retweet did not make him question Trump&apos;s recent outreach to Democrats but was disturbing.&quot;It is distressing, though, to have a president that frankly will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that,&quot; Schiff said on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; program. &quot;It doesn&apos;t help, I think in terms of his stature, it doesn&apos;t help in terms of the stature of our whole country.&quot; (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe) ÂŠ Thomson Reuters 2017 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 8 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images Originally published on September 17, 2017 3:02 pm 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday.   © 2017 KRVS</text>

      <title>Scott Adams: Hillary Clinton Lost Because @realDonaldTrump Is ‘Funny As Hell’</title>
      <text>Sep 17, 2017 by GotNews 0 Source: YouTube screenshot. Dilbert creator Scott Adams says President Donald Trump won the 2016 election in part because he’s “funny as hell” compared to excuse-making Hillary Clinton. 
Early Sunday morning, Trump retweeted a GIF showing him hitting a golf ball that knocks Clinton into her plane. Donald Trump’s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary http://pic.twitter.com/vKhxxFCBV1 
Trump deploys “linguistic kill-shots,” as Adams says. Clinton’s plodding campaign memoir is nothing compared to even a Trump retweet. Scott Adams can’t stop laughing at President Trump’s “Rocket Man” tweet https://t.co/vKPLzoeMkS 
— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) September 17, 2017 
“All week Hillary Clinton’s been pushing her book and saying increasingly ridiculous things about why she lost,” Adams said. 
“Do you know which one she left out? That Trump is funny as hell,” he added. “You have to admit, some number of people voted for him just because he’s funnier. You know that’s true and she left that one out.” 
Axios tallied up at least 16 headache-inducing excuses from What Happened , including her “damn emails,”“Russia,” James Comey, sexism, Obama, the DNC, the press—the list goes on. 
“So what’s hilarious about this, is all this week she’s been talking about all the things and the reasons why she lost, and then he just tweets this little—that just perfectly captures what was wrong with her personality compared to his, right?” Adams said. 
“Now, obviously, everybody reacts to these two personalities differently, but nobody’s going to tell you she had a sense of humor and nobody’s going to tell you he didn’t. And I’m here to tell you, that did make a difference,” he said. 
While it may 4-D chess or just serendipitous, the user’s handle is “fuctedupmind,” which can’t be repeated on cable television, thus limiting CNN’s ability to blackmail the latest meme-maker. 
Adams famously said in August 2015 Trump “bitch-slapped” the Republican establishment, owned Fox News, and correctly predicted he would win against Clinton come the general election. Trump was a “clown genius.” 
When the country has so many problems and things seem grim, Trump starts tweeting, leftists start crying before brunch, and we all laugh at the latest presidential shot fired at the smug and entitled “elite” trying to stop the MAGA agenda at all costs. 
Stay tuned for more.</text>

      <title>Iran&apos;s Khamenei: Tehran will not bow to US bullying | News | Al Jazeera</title>
      <text>Iran will not give in to US &quot;bullying&quot; as Washington attempts to undermine Tehran&apos;s nuclear deal with world powers, the Islamic Republic&apos;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said.
&quot;Iran, which is a powerful nation, will not give in to pressure and will not bow,&quot; Khamenei said in an address to police officers in Tehran on Sunday.
&quot;The corrupt, lying, deceitful US officials insolently accuse the nation of Iran ... of lying, whereas the nation of Iran has acted honestly and will continue on this path until the end in an honest manner,&quot; said Khamenei.

WATCH: Uncertainty persists over US sanctions against Iran (1:52)
President Hassan Rouhani left on Sunday for the UN General Assembly in New York, where he is set to hold crucial talks on the 2015 nuclear deal, which eased international sanctions in exchange for curbs to Iran&apos;s atomic programme.
US President Donald Trump has threatened to tear up the deal and his administration has been looking for grounds to declare Iran in non-compliance, despite repeated UN declarations that Tehran has stuck to its commitments.
Trump must make a decision by mid-October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal.
Khamenei said in his speech that &quot;US bullying will not work on the Islamic Republic.&quot;
&quot;You are the liars. The nation of Iran is standing firm and any wrong move ... will face a reaction by the Islamic Republic,&quot; said the supreme leader.
Iran&apos;s warning Iran said last month it could abandon the nuclear agreement &quot;within hours&quot; if the US imposes any new penalties, after Washington ordered unilateral sanctions over Tehran&apos;s ballistic missile tests.
Rouhani, speaking on Sunday before leaving for New York, said the US should join the countries that continue to support the nuclear deal.

The US imposed unilateral sanctions in July, saying Tehran&apos;s ballistic missile tests violated a UN resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal, and called upon Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons .
It stopped short of explicitly barring such activity.
Iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons.

      <title>Trump tweets about North Korea’s ‘Rocket Man’</title>
      <text>U.S. President Donald Trump | Drew Angerer/Getty Images Trump tweets about North Korea’s ‘Rocket Man’ 
By POLITICO 9/17/17, 2:26 PM CET 
President Donald Trump began Sunday with a tweet Sunday taking a dig at North Korea’s leader, referring to him as “Rocket Man.” 
“I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!,” the president tweet. 
Trump’s was referring to Moon Jae-in, current leader of South Korea, and Kim Jong Un, the North Korean strongman who has been pursuing the ability to launch missiles at any and all enemies. Presumably the “Rocket Man” reference was to the Elton John song from 1972. 
The president also re-tweeted a tweet taking aim at the New York Times and sent a note of thanks to someone named Lana Del Fenty for tweeting “we love and support Trump!” — and she responded in kind with thanks and surprise (“My phone can’t handle all of this omg”). Authors:</text>

      <title>Iran Leader Khamenei Warns Against U.S. &apos;Wrong Move&apos; on Nuclear Deal</title>
      <text>Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. (AP Photo/Ebrahim Noroozi) (Reuters/AP) - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday Iran would react strongly to any “wrong move” by the United States on Tehran’s nuclear accord with world powers, days after President Donald Trump said Iran violated the agreement’s “spirit.”
“The Iranian nation is standing firm and any wrong move by the domineering regime regarding the (nuclear accord) will face the reaction of the Islamic Republic,” state media Quote: d Ayatollah Khamenei as saying.
Washington extended some sanctions relief for Iran on Thursday under Tehran’s 2015 deal with world powers but said it had yet to decide whether to maintain the agreement.
Trump, who must make a decision by mid-October, said Iran was violating “the spirit” of the deal under which it got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear programme.
“Today, despite all the commitments and discussions in the negotiations, America’s attitude towards these negotiations and their outcome is completely unjust and amounts to bullying,” Khamenei said.
“The Americans should know that the Iranian people will stand firm on their honorable positions and on important issues related to national interests, there will be no retreat by the Islamic Republic,” Khamenei said in a speech to Iranian military academy graduates.
Iran said last month it could abandon the nuclear agreement “within hours” if the United States imposes any new penalties, after Washington ordered sanctions over Tehran’s ballistic missile tests.
The United States imposed unilateral sanctions after saying the missile tests violated a U.N. resolution, which endorsed the nuclear deal and called upon Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such technology.
It stopped short of explicitly barring such activity.
Iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile, Iran’s president said he is “inviting” the U.S. to dinner as he heads to New York for the U.N General Assembly.
President Hassan Rouhani used an analogy of a dinner party on Sunday to describe how countries are benefiting from the 2015 nuclear deal.
Rouhani described the Americans as “sitting in another room” at the party.
Rouhani said: “They can adopt a new path and come to the room where the dinner table is. That’s alright in our opinion. If they change their bad temper they can enjoy the dinner table.”
The nuclear deal under former President Barack Obama saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. President Donald Trump has said he wants to renegotiate it.</text>

      <text>Top US diplomat says closing embassy in Cuba &apos;under review&apos; Posted: Updated: (AP Photo/Desmond Boylan, File). FILE - In this Aug. 14, 2015, file photo, a U.S. flag flies at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba. U.S. investigators are chasing many theories about what’s harming American diplomats in Cuba, including a sonic attack, el... Graphic shows symptoms reported by U.S. diplomats in Cuba; 2c x 6 inches; 96.3 mm x 152 mm; By JOSH LEDERMANAssociated Press 
NEW YORK (AP) - The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday. 
Tillerson&apos;s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after a half-century of estrangement. 
&quot;We have it under evaluation,&quot; Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. &quot;It&apos;s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We&apos;ve brought some of those people home. It&apos;s under review.&quot; 
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims - diplomats and their families - some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported . 
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential &quot;sonic attack.&quot; Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. 
Tillerson once called the events &quot;health attacks,&quot; but the State Department has since used the term &quot;incidents&quot; while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn&apos;t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it&apos;s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter. 
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected. 
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn&apos;t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. 
A decision to shutter the embassy, even temporarily, would deal a demoralizing blow to the delicate detente that President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro announced in late 2014. The next year, embassies were reopened and restrictions on travel and commerce eased - signs of a warming relationship that displeased some hard-liners in Cuba&apos;s government. President Donald Trump has reversed some of the changes, but left many in place. 
Tillerson spoke on CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week. 
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it&apos;s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit. 
The U.S. hasn&apos;t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn&apos;t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba&apos;s security services might be involved. 
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States - a move with dramatic diplomatic implications 
&quot;Cuba&apos;s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,&quot; said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who led the effort, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American and critic of the U.S. detente. 
The incidents have frightened Havana&apos;s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.

      <title>Trump hypes mock video of golf ball seen striking Clinton</title>
      <text>Trump hypes mock video of golf ball seen striking Clinton Posted: By HOPE YENAssociated Press 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump took another swing at Hillary Clinton in the latest sign that his campaign fury hasn&apos;t faded, retweeting a mock video that shows him smacking a golf ball that - in the next frame - seemingly strikes her in the back before she stumbles and falls down while boarding a plane. 
Trump retweeted the brief video on his official Twitter account early Sunday, which appears to be a doctored version of news footage from 2011 that shows the then-secretary of state falling after climbing the airplane stairs. The re-edited video appears to have superimposed images of a golf ball that is shown hitting Clinton. 
The tweet says: &quot;Donald Trump&apos;s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary.&quot; 
A Clinton spokesman declined comment. The White House issued no immediate comment, and Trump aides have said in the past that his tweets &quot;speak for themselves.&quot; The assessment from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: &quot;juvenile.&quot; 
Back in July, Trump vented his rage against the media by posting someone else&apos;s doctored anti-CNN video that showed Trump pummeling a man in a business suit - the man&apos;s face obscured by the CNN logo - outside a wrestling ring. 
Trump has stepped up his criticism of Clinton since the Democratic presidential nominee re-emerged in the spotlight to promote her new book about the 2016 campaign. She is unsparing in her assessment of Trump, calling him &quot;a clear and present danger to the country and the world.&quot; 
Trump often cites his electoral vote victory as evidence of campaign prowess and popularity with Americans. He is quick to challenge or criticize anyone or anything that might undercut that premise. Trump has established a commission to investigate his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally in 2016, when Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes. 
&quot;It is distressing though to have a president that, frankly, will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that,&quot; Schiff said on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; Sunday. &quot;It doesn&apos;t help, I think, in terms of his stature. It doesn&apos;t help in terms of the stature of our whole country.&quot; 
Clinton&apos;s book assigns blame for her presidential loss on several factors, including interference from Russian hackers, accusations leveled at her by former FBI Director James Comey and even her gender. The White House has criticized the book, with spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it &quot;sad&quot; that the last chapter of Clinton&apos;s public life will be defined by selling books with &quot;false and reckless attacks.&quot; 
In a pair of tweets last week, Trump took direct aim at Clinton. 
&quot;Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!&quot; Trump wrote. 
Referring to Clinton&apos;s past description of some Trump supporters, he later tweeted: &quot;The &apos;deplorables&apos; came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!&quot;

      <title>White House denies backtracking on Paris pact withdrawal</title>
      <text>Updated 9/17/17, 3:00 PM CET 
The White House denied Saturday that the administration was backtracking on its long-held plans to withdraw from the Paris climate deal. 
“There has been no change in the United States’ position on the Paris agreement. As the President has made abundantly clear, the United States is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country,” said White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, in a statement. 
The denial came after the Wall Street Journal reported that a White House senior official, Everett Eissenstat, had told people at a meeting of energy ministers in Montreal that the administration may revise or craft a new climate deal and emissions standards rather than pull out altogether, according to a top European energy official cited by the Journal. 
As recently as early August, the White House signaled its intent to continue the process of withdrawal by delivering an official notice to the United Nations vis-à-vis the State Department. 
President Donald Trump announced his intentions to withdraw the U.S. from the agreement in June during a speech in the Rose Garden – though under the terms of the original deal, the U.S. cannot fully withdraw until Nov. 4, 2020. 
The president also indicated at that time that he would be open to re-entering the climate pact if he believed the United States could get out of it what Trump deemed a better deal. 
The State Department announced last month that the U.S. would continue participating in international climate change negotiations, including talks aimed at implementing the Paris pact, “to protect U.S. interests and ensure all future policy options remain open to the administration.” 
Since then, the international community has largely been left in the dark about the United States’ plans. Foreign diplomats have long suspected that the U.S. will ultimately remain in the agreement, while weakening former President Barack Obama’s pledge to cut domestic emissions 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. 
Diplomats have been buzzing about this weekend’s climate meeting in Montreal, where energy ministers were set to discuss the climate deal.</text>

      <title>tillerson: Tillerson says U.S. could stay in Paris climate accord</title>
      <text>WASHINGTON,   The United States could remain in the Paris climate accord under the right conditions, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday.
President Donald Trump was willing to work with partners in the Paris agreement if the United States could construct a set of terms that are fair and balanced for Americans, Tillerson said on the CBS &quot;Face The Nation&quot; program.
&quot;The president said he is open to finding those conditions where we can remain engaged with others on what we all agree is still a challenging issue,&quot; Tillerson said.
Trump administration officials said the United States would not pull out of the agreement and had offered to re-engage in the deal, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. U.S. officials attended a meeting on Saturday of ministers from more than 30 of the nations that signed the climate-change agreement.
Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the United States from the 2015 global climate pact, arguing it would undermine the U.S. economy and national sovereignty. The decision drew anger and condemnation from world leaders.
Tillerson said Gary Cohn , Trump&apos;s top economic adviser, was overseeing the issue.
&quot;So I think the plan is for director Cohn to consider other ways in which we can work with partners in the Paris Climate Accord. We want to be productive. We want to be helpful,&quot; said.
Similar sentiments were expressed on Sunday by national security adviser H.R. McMaster , who said on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; program that Trump was open to &quot;any discussions that will help us improve the environment.&quot;
&quot;He left the door open to re-entering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States,&quot; said McMaster. &quot;If there&apos;s an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly.&quot;
The accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, was meant to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less by 2100, mainly through pledges to cut carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe )</text>

      <title>Re: The Classification of IPOB as a Terrorist Organization: The Buhari Administration and Military Correctly Classified IPOB as a Terrorist Organization, Legally Speaking—a Primer on Terrorism BY AKINTUNDE ADEYEMO—Sunday, September 17, 2017 (2: 15a.m).</title>
      <text>
All over the Western world, there are variations of the definition of the word “terrorist” but, at its basic, the definition is simple: “The word “terrorist” has its roots in the Latin terrere, which means &quot;to frighten&quot; (New York Times columnist William Safire).

I don’t want to go into the history of terrorism (I have enough articles about that on my blog), but there are “waves” of terrorism. Post-Cold War (beginning with the collapse of the Berlin Wall), states have mostly dealt with “religious terrorist groups;” this shouldn’t be surprising for political observers (September 11, 2001 attacks cemented this particular “wave” of terrorism).

In the last couple of decades, however, certain marginalized groups (especially irredentists) have tacitly adopted “terror” to advance their objectives—statehood.

The notion of irredentism is back: The collapsed Yugoslavia was the melting pot of irredentism (brutal Yugoslav wars preceded the 2006 referendum that created an independent nation of Montenegro, and the Republic of Kosovo was formed in 2008).

After 10 years, with 140k people dead and 4 million plus displaced, the former Yugoslavia was divided into seven countries—Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Kosovo. If you are going to carve Nigeria, as you have all been wishing, Yugoslavia is your perfect model, for it was ethnically and religiously divided, too (it’s wishful thinking to think that we can pray our way out of this mess—ask Israel and Palestine). Secession is an ugly affair (not a child’s play). In Yugoslavia, different groups used terrorism to achieve their objectives.

By the way, the end goal of terrorism is to gain more political power, especially the power to rule as you see fit.

Terrorism has become a tool that irredentists and other ethno-nationalist groups use to do advance their objectives. All over the world, this new method is nothing new: Ethnic groups, who harbor a deep distrust of central governments, have vowed to make their countries ungovernable unless their wishes are met.

States, however, don’t easily succumb to threats from these groups; hence, a broad framework has been established to isolate these groups that threaten the peace and stability of states.

Rather than succumb to threats and tactics of these “ethno-nationalist separatist and irredentist groups, who are involved in “dangerous acts” designed “to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,” a government can classify such groups (or its members) as domestic terrorists (See 18 U.S.C. § 2331 or Patriot Act).

In the United States for example, some anti-abortion activities may be categorized as an act of domestic terrorism. Pursuant to the United States Code, an organization that uses extreme violence can also be labeled a terrorist organization (it is one thing to believe that God doesn’t like abortion, but a different thing to threaten, or kill, abortion providers).

Consider this terrorist organization—“Army of God (AOG), a Christian terrorist organization that has engaged in the use of anti-abortion violence in the United States to fight against abortion” (See Terrorist Organization Profile: Army of God. National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism).

You have to understand that terrorism is a broad term, which experts have painstakingly categorized into sub-categories. In America, professors, who teach terrorism, give various definitions to help their students grasp the complexity of terrorism (Back at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh, for a whole semester, I studied terrorism under Professor John Sawicki, equally my professor of War and Peace in Nuclear Age).

To most people, including learned (and smart) people who have not studied terrorism, they might think a typical terrorist will be someone like Osama Bin Laden, and that a typical terrorist organization will be Boko Haram or ISIS. That, based on my own training on terrorism, would be a falsehood.

To experts and others who have studied this complex topic, terrorism can include “eco-terrorists and extreme animal rights,” in fact, “the FBI called eco-terrorists and extreme animal rights one of the most serious domestic terrorism threats in the U.S. today&quot; (See &quot;FBI – Using Intel Against Eco-Terrorists: https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2008/june/ecoterror_063008 &quot;).

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, “Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is a domestic terrorist organization” (See &quot;What is domestic extremism?&quot;, National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit (NETCU)).

Let me give you one more example, and I will move on: Do you think a political organization can be labeled a domestic terrorist organization? Yes. When Obama was the president, his appointees at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigations labeled Anti-Fascist Action (popularly known as ANIFA)— “grouping of autonomous far-left militant organizations”— as a domestic terrorist organization.

Today, ANIFA are commonly known to disrupt political rallies, especially those rallies organized by the Republic party, all in the name of political resistance.

Post-Cold War, there are four distinct categories of Non-State terrorist organizations: “1. Secular left-wing groups (examples are Sendero Luminoso (SL: Shining Path) in Peru, Action Directe (AD: Direct Action) in France, Cellules Combattantes Communistes (CCC: Fighting Communist Cells) in Belgium, and Prima Linea (PL: Front Line) in Italy).  2. Ethno-nationalist separatist and irredentist groups (examples are the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), (PKK: Kurdistan Worker’s Party), Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA: Basque Fatherland and Freedom [now you can add IPOB, per the Buhari administration]). 3. Secular right-wing groups (examples are the Milliyetçilik Haraket Partisi (MHP: Nationalist Action Party) in Turkey, the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB: Afrikaner Resistance Movement) in South Africa, and the Minutemen in the U.S.). 4. Religious terrorist groups (examples are the Phineas Priesthood and the Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (CSA) in the U.S; al-Harakāt al-Muqāwwama al-Islāmīyya (HAMĀS: Islamic Resistance Movement); Aum Shinrikyō (Aum Supreme Truth) in Japan, and [Boko Haram in Nigeria].” (See What Is Terrorism? Jeffrey M. Bale, Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey).

In this article, I will focus on number 2—ethno-nationalist separatists and irredentist groups, for IPOB falls into that category, pursuant to the Buhari administration.

With that basic understanding of terrorism, it is imperative that we understand how Western countries have defined terrorism, particularly the United States, Britain, and Canada. This definition helps to decipher whether a group fits under this definition of terrorism (by the way, these three countries share the same, or similar, view on terrorism): Pursuant to Canada’s Criminal Code, Section 83.01, terrorism is defined as an act committed: “In whole or in part of a political, religious, or ideological purpose, objective, or cause” with the intention of intimidating the public “…with regard to its security…including economic security, or compelling a person, a government or a domestic or an international organization to do or to refrain from doing any act&quot; (See Canada&apos;s Criminal Code, British Terrorism Act (2006), and Patriot Act).

Also, this definition is no different than the one that the Buhari administration has adopted.

When we analyze some activities of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), we also have to talk about The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB). These two groups have different modus operandi. IPOB came on the scene to aggressively establish what MASSOB has failed to achieve (comparatively, you should think of The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Hamas. Hamas shared the same dream with PLO—to achieve a statehood—but it thought PLO was to idealistic, so Hamas aggressively challenged Israel).

Akin, but Hamas achieved some victory against Israel and it also undermined PLO. Yes, but thousands of people also died and PLO still controls Palestine (and Hamas is now labeled as a terrorist organization by Israel and the United States).

When some people talk about a peaceful recession, I can’t help but invoke this line: Some Nigerians play too much (you don’t secede by invoking the principle of morality, as most analysts have been doing, but by the principle of war).

I know you appreciate people who want to tell you what you want to hear, but I was trained to extract my emotion from my analysis (in international relations, there are two basic school of thoughts—idealism and realism. Idealists (or Wilsonians) will continue to tell you how the principles of morality and rule of law are being consistently violated (what ought to be), but they’ve always misjudged the nature of the system, just like how Neville Chamberlain and Woodrow Wilson did, reality always expose their utopian views of the world.

Another time-tested philosophy is the realism school of thought, which I belong: I respect the rule of law; I understand the principle of morality, but a state cannot look away when some fringe elements threaten its unity. If these fringe elements overpower the state, morality and rule of law will be hard to observe, for we would all have returned to the “state of nature, for life in the state of nature is &quot;solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short” (Chapter XIII.: Of the Natural Condition of Mankind As Concerning Their Felicity, and Misery.&quot;. Leviathan).

This was the same condition that Colonel Ojukwu brought on us, but we fought our way out (have you forgotten)? Some citizens of certain countries—South Sudan, Yemen, and Congo— currently live in the same volatile condition. In these countries, irredentists and warlords have taken over the affairs of the state. In the absence of a strong central government, citizens of these countries live in fear.

In some sense, IPOB sees itself as a more vibrant, or charismatic, successor of MASSOB but, when one looks at how Kanu and his followers have conducted themselves, one cannot but said that they took a risky bet—they undermined the resolute and resolve of President Buhari to keep Nigeria intact. Additionally, they overestimated their strengths, a serious strategic blunder from a political standpoint. What am I talking about?

Nigeria, regardless of its current political and economic turmoil, is still a strong militaristic state (think of Pakistan, a democratic state, but its military is its gatekeeper against India, a more powerful neighbor). Since 1960, the military has served as the last resort to prevent the disintegration of Nigeria (yes, some of its campaigns might fall outside the scope of international law, but the United States and other Western powers have always overlooked its excesses).

For instance, when President Obama sanctioned the military for its brutal campaign against Boko Haram, President Trump lifted those sanctions and sold more weapons to the Nigerian military. Furthermore, there is a joint agreement between our military and the Californian National Guard (some top officers came to the United States as recently as August 2017. I missed my appointment with them by a few hours, for they had visited my boss’ boss, General Vadnais, during a military training exercise in Michigan).

My point is this: The military sees itself as the gatekeeper of our country and, if directed by any president, the military will comply. President Goodluck Jonathan, from the Ijaw ethnic group, ordered the military to carry out massive military campaigns in northeastern Nigeria, the military complied (we all know that those areas were and are still being devastated). President Obasanjo, from the Yoruba ethnic group, ordered the military to carry out massive military campaigns in Odi in Bayelsa State, the military complied. Let’s stop ethnicizing everything that has to do with Nigeria.

President Buhari, from the Hausa ethnic group, has ordered the military to carry out a surgical training exercise in Aba, Abia, and the military is complying (by the way, Buhari also ordered the military to deliver a serious blow to Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria).

Look, the affairs of a state are always messy; the military does the dirty job for politicians, anywhere in the world. President Buhari is not callous; he is doing what Western leaders (or those you called civilized people) would have done, if presented with the same situation (look, we don’t have a National Guard in Nigeria, and The Nigerian Police Force is ill-prepared to carry out this task, so the military has traditionally carried out some of these roles. It is falsehood to allege that soldiers don’t invade American streets, for some tactical gears used by our local American police officer are better than what Nigerian soldiers use).

Kanu made a strategic blunder by invoking vitriolic attacks against other ethnic groups and the federal government of Nigeria (I can call Donald Trump a stupid man, but I can’t threaten his life, and I can’t threaten my fellow citizens’ lives—FBI will knock on my door.

I understand the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and I also understand that free speech should be extended to both political expressions and freedom of expression; however, once free speech rises to the level of fighting words or hate speech, it is not protected under the First Amendment: Per hate speech (or fighting words), their content embodies a particularly intolerable (and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey” (See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1992)).

Kanu, before “Operation Python Dance,” was not preaching like Ghandi, but he was speaking like someone who was ready to go toe to toe with the federal government: He kept raining insults on other ethnic groups; the pressure kept building without no abatement. At one point, he vowed to visit Lagos, but some Lagosians drew the red line—Lagos is not Aba (you will be annihilated in Lagos, they warned); he retreated. At the time, people were cheering Kanu on Facebook; his strength grew. Have you forgotten? If you are a serious analyst, you have to take a retrospective look on this matter. We didn’t get here by accident.

Some people have underestimated how influential Kanu had become (they called him so many sweet names; you would think they are romantically involved with this man), but they have forgotten to mention that Kanu had loyal supporters who carried out his destructive instructions.

The writing was on the wall, but some observers failed to see it; however, military intelligence revealed to Buhari (when he returned from London) showed that IPOB and Kanu were becoming a clear and present danger to the peace and stability of Nigeria.

In my own opinion, President Buhari wanted to first throw an idealistic approach at this hot topic so, in his first major speech upon his return from London, he dedicated the entire speech to the issue of secession and unity (i.e., national security): President Buhari was abundantly clear—“Nigeria’s unity non-negotiable.” People were so furious, but not curious (how can he focus on national security, they asked)?

The next day, I analyze his speech: I called it the best speech of his presidency. And some apolitical people thought I was crazy (they called me delusional). I laughed, for they (political neophytes) never understood how political leaders think.

I was not trained to understand “feel-good” messages, but I was trained to analyze ambiguous messages, for politicians don’t tell you exactly what they will do (you have to be an expert to understand the underlying message(s)).

From reading and watching that speech, I got the impression that President Buhari was extending an olive branch to Kanu and others, but Kanu thought Buhari was too weak to do anything: That turned out to be a mirage, for the General was back (the “rats” affair caused commotion, for it painted a weak government, but that wasn’t the case. Kanu took the “rats” joke too far—he thought Buhari was a weak president).

The question on everybody’s mind should have been this: Why did it take the government so long to curtail Kanu’s incitement? Well, you know the answer (President Buhari probably struggled with this decision). But, once Kanu wouldn’t hold back, he gave Buhari no choice (I am sure that the military has a folder that contains all those videos of Kanu inciting his men to “burn down the country”). It wasn’t a rhetoric (he claimed to have a “secret unit). He was propagandizing all along, until the Army took him seriously, which exposed Kanu’s puffery.

By classifying Kanu as a terrorist organization, it helps the government to delegitimize Kanu’s ambition; in fact, Washington and Downing Street will likely give President Buhari some leeway to stabilize Nigeria.

Concerning President Obasanjo’s admonition, the former president doesn’t have any credibility on this matter (he would have done the same thing; in fact, he would have acted before now). There is only one president at a time, and that is President Buhari (When Obama counsels Trump, does he listen? When Bush tried to talk Obama out of the CIA waterboarding program, did Obama listen? No). If you are not the president, you’ve no moral, or ethical, obligation, to keep Nigeria intact (ko ni ti ori mi baje—Buhari won’t let this country disintegrate before his eyes).

After Kanu refused to listen to what Buhari was preaching (post-Buhari’s speech, Kanu even paraded a ragtag army; when you are analyzing conflicts or politics, look at the timeline of events), President Buhari decided to demystify Kanu’s illusion by sanctioning the military to conduct “Operation Python Dance.”

Look at the name of the operation and tell me that you didn’t get the underlying message—it was just a show of force, not designed to harm, but Kanu’s followers escalated the “Python dance.”

Have you looked up the definition of Python lately? “Python is a genus of nonvenomous pythons.” What of “venomous”? According to the Oxford dictionary, it means (“of a person or their behavior) full of malice or spite.

Here, we are dealing with “nonvenmous,” though: So the military didn’t come to show malice, or spite, but Kanu took the bait, which gave the military an excuse to change their mission; hence, the declaration of IPOB as a terrorist organization, which is consistent with the definition of domestic terrorism, under both customary law and international law.

Now, for those supporting Kanu, don’t be so stupid to call yourself a terrorist on Facebook, for you are digging a hole for yourself (if America needs the vote of Nigeria at the United Nations, and it wants Nigeria to support her, in return, the Buhari administration can lobby the United States to add IPOB to its broad list of terrorist organizations).

And, regardless of your intent, you will likely be labeled a member of a terrorist organization (if you already live in America, and you are going to apply for a Green Card, stay away from this hot button issue, for it might hurt you). In the future, you don’t want to pay me thousands of dollars to argue your case before an immigration judge.

Finally, we should start asking for experts’ opinions, not just general opinions from pseudo “Facebook experts” who are too emotional to understand some of these nuances (when you watch CNN, they have different experts on different areas; in Nigeria, once a jobless graduate of business administration starts blogging on Facebook, he is deemed an expert in weapon proliferation or ballistic missiles). Just like you would trust your dentist, not me, as to how to remove a painful tooth, stop trusting emotional analysts (start trusting the right people).

On the surface, politics might look simple but, when you take a basic survey course in political science, you will understand that politics is a tree with different branches.

      <title>Bernie’s “Medicare for All” actually is the pragmatic health care solution - Salon.com</title>
      <text>Sunday, Sep 17, 2017 12:00 PM EDT Bernie’s “Medicare for All” actually is the pragmatic health care solution Those who claim we have to stick with incremental, &quot;common-sense&quot; measures are living in the political past Topics: &quot;Medicare for All&quot; bill , Bernie Sanders , Democratic Party , Democrats , Health Care , medicare for all , Senate Democrats , single payer health care , Single-Payer Health Care , Politics News , News Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. (Credit: AP/Andrew Harnik) 
“Medicare for All” is an idea whose time has finally come — at least conceptually, which is more than half the battle. When Sen. Bernie Sanders announced his “Medicare for All” plan last week , he had 16 Senate co-sponsors , compared to exactly none when he proposed a similar bill in 2011 . That’s a third of the Senate Democrats, and more importantly, it included several perceived contenders for the 2020 nomination, such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey. 
What’s more, there’s now a 53 percent majority supporting the idea, according to a June Kaiser Family Foundation poll , with independent support at 55 percent, up 12 points since 2008-9. Support was malleable in both directions. Arguments against — raising taxes and giving government too much control — could raise opposition up to 62 percent, while arguments in favor — reducing administrative costs and ensuring health care as a right — could raise support to 72 percent. Support among Democrats, at 64 percent, should naturally be expected to rise if the leading primary candidates all support the idea. 
Yet there was immediate pushback, and not just from Republicans, as might be expected. The story headlines alone tell the tale of peril — “ How Single-Payer Health Care Could Trip Up Democrats ,” by Margot Sanger-Katz at t he New York Times , “ ‘Medicare for All’ will be a trap for Democrats if they’re not careful ,” by Josh Barro at Business Insider — or folly — “ The Single-Payer Insanity ,” by Bill Scher at Politico , “ Bernie Sanders’s Bill Gets America Zero Percent Closer to Single Payer ,” by Jonathan Chait at New York magazine. These knee-jerk responses are all in the name of realism, of course, but it’s more like the “crackpot realism” derided decades ago by C. Wright Mills. The reality it refers to is falling apart all around them, as the underlying assumptions have simply ceased to hold. 
What’s now emerging is a clearer-than-ever divide between those still buying into existing politics — even those with undeniable progressive instincts and values — and those who want and demand fundamental change. While it’s still very important to heed “reality-based” arguments, from a larger historical perspective, these arguments themselves lost touch with how rapidly and reality is changing. If the old common-sense assumptions had held, Bernie Sanders would never have won single a primary and Donald Trump certainly wouldn’t be president today. 
Not just here in America but across Europe as well, the existing political consensus is eroding. Something new is almost surely going to replace it — the only question is what. It won’t mean throwing everything out, wholesale. But it will mean reassessing things in a whole new light. The common sense of what “everybody knows” is changing and everybody knows that, even those who are still clinging desperately to their denial. 
At the New Republic , Clio Chang’s lucid rebuttal, “ Why Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All Plan Is Good Politics ,” highlights some of the key false assumptions made by critics. To begin with, she quotes Sanger-Katz: 
Like “repeal and replace,” “single-payer” is a broadly popular slogan that papers over intraparty disagreements and wrenching policy choices. … If the Democrats eventually wrested back power, they could find themselves similarly factionalized and stymied over the details. 
And Chait: 
At no point does [Sanders] grant that the most important source of opposition will come from actual American voters concerned about losing their current plan or paying higher taxes. 
Then Chang observes: 
What these criticisms share is an underlying belief that Democrats are racing leftward on health care for short-term political gain — namely, appeasing the demands of the progressive base — without taking into account the long-term repercussions and whether Medicare for All is even feasible. But Sanders’s proposal is not a cynical slogan like “repeal and replace,” nor is it an inflexible roadmap that will invariably lead to a political dead end. It is better understood as a historic breakthrough in the way that Democrats approach health care, opening the door for all kinds of fixes to a system that nearly everyone agrees is too expensive and too inefficient. 
Chang’s point ought to be so obvious it goes without saying. But clearly it’s not. But fast forward two years to 2019, with the 2020 Democratic primary in full swing, and it almost certainly will be. “Repeal and replace” had no content to it — it was all sizzle, no steak. There was no “there” there. It was the hollowest of slogans, even apart from the cynicism involved. “Medicare for All,” in contrast, stakes out an aspiration of universal coverage already achieved by other advanced industrial nations. It overflows with possible alternatives, even as Sanders has thought carefully about how to craft the specific proposal he advanced this week. 
As Chang goes on to note: 
[A] party that is united in this goal, but divided on the means of attaining it, can still be an effective one. Amidst Sanders’s push for single-payer, we have seen alternatives being developed by other Democrats like Chris Murphy and Brian Schatz , both of whom are committed to the goal of universal coverage. Critics say Sanders’s plan precludes more incremental approaches, but you can also say that the momentum Sanders is building helps generate more of them. 
At Think Progress, Ian Millhiser posed “ 7 tough questions single-payer advocates must answer before their ideas can become law ,” which can function as a sort of Rorschach test. It can be read in naysaying fashion, as a corollary to the knee-jerk criticisms Chang was responding to — especially when referencing an early August article in the Nation, “ Medicare-for-All Isn’t the Solution for Universal Health Care ,” by Joshua Holland. But it can also be read positively, as a serious to-do list for those working to make Medicare for All a reality, in one form or another. 
Indeed, even Holland’s piece is more complicated than its title suggests, as shown by how he draws on arguments from economist Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, who is a himself a single-payer advocate. Baker points out that the enormous cost savings other countries enjoy are the cumulative products of decades of cost controls. They can’t simply be realized with the wave of a magic wand. 
This is a crucial point that has to be addressed down the line. But it should not distract us from the fact that such savings are clearly possible. Gradual changes in cost structures that turn drastic over time are routine stuff in the world of budget wonkery. What’s not routine is making them work for ordinary Americans, rather than against them. 
Sher’s piece at Politico adds something different, however. He argues: 
The Democratic Party now is, for all intents and purposes, the party of single-payer health insurance. 
Big mistake. 
Democrats are committing themselves to years more of a treacherous health care debate, at a time when there are more pressing issues to confront. 
There are two things wrong with Scher’s argument here: First, it’s ludicrous to think that health care would disappear as an issue if not for single-payer advocacy. 
Sanders has a much more realistic sense of what’s going on when he points out that the GOP attack on health care is going to continue, regardless of what Democrats do. T he GOP attempt to destroy Obamacare was not just about tax cuts for the rich, as he told the Nation’s John Nichols in a recent interview , it was about the whole Koch brothers’ ideology of dismantling government: 
This is the beginning. If they are successful in destroying Medicaid, Medicare certainly will be next and Social Security not far behind that — and the Veterans Administration, as well. So this is part of a massive effort by the Koch brothers and other billionaires to take us back to the 1920s and to do away with virtually every major piece of legislation passed since the 1930s to meet the needs of our people. 
An effort that grand in scope and sweeping in vision requires something equally grand and sweeping in opposition — and 50 years of history shows how desperately such a grand opposition is needed. This is the second problem with Scher’s argument: It ignores the potential catalytic role that Medicare for All can play in helping to provide progressives and Democrats with much-needed coherence and sense of shared vision. 
In their landmark 1967 book, “ The Political Beliefs of Americans: A Study of Public Opinion ,” Lloyd Free and Hadley Cantril showed that Americans overwhelmingly favor specific liberal social programs for the results they produce — by roughly two-to-one — while more narrowly favoring small government and the free market in the abstract, as a matter of ideology. This “schizoid condition” is troubling when it comes to making public policy. In the book’s closing section, “The Need for a Restatement of American Ideology,” they said, “ There is little doubt that the time has come for a restatement of American ideology to bring it in line with what the great majority of people want and approve.” 
Of course, that never happened, which is a big part of the problem confronting progressives and Democrats to this very day. The fight for Medicare for All could help change that, precisely because it has an ideological dimension — the belief that government has a vital constructive role to play in helping to make people’s lives better — and because health care is so intimately important to virtually everyone in American society. 
More recently, the book “ Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats “ by Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins (Salon review here ), showed how the attitudinal divide discovered by Free and Cantril is reflected and amplified by different aspects of party political culture. The GOP has flourished as the agent of a coherent movement-conservative philosophy, while the Democratic Party has represented a pragmatic coalition of group interests advancing specific problem-solving policies. Each party would clearly benefit from being more like the other. If GOP policies actually produced promised real-world results, their governance record would improve significantly. And Democrats would surely win more elections if they better expressed what they stood for more broadly, as Free and Cantril argued 50 years ago. 
That’s where Medicare for All comes in. It engages virtually all the interest groups represented by the Democrats, so it’s grounded in the party-as-it-is, even as it embodies an ideological perspective with the potential to unite them. The exact form that ideology takes is not predetermined: There are any number of ways that government can help make people’s lives better, and a vigorous effort to come up with the best possible solution will only help make this abstract possibility increasingly concrete for tens of millions of Americans in the next few years. 
Another reason why Medicare for All can be so crucial is its mobilizing potential. As Chang notes: 
Setting up Medicare for All as a goal is a way to activate movement politics, to give people a reason to go to the polls and make phone calls. We have already seen the fruits of those efforts: that 16 senators have signed on to the plan is due more to sustained grassroots organizing than anything else. 
Maintaining turnout — especially in down-ballot and midterm elections — has been a key Democratic weakness for the past 25 years, most notably in the disastrous 1994 and 2010 elections. The 1999 book “ Reading Mixed Signals: Ambivalence in American Public Opinion about Government ,” by Albert H. Cantril and Susan Davis Cantril, found that critics of government made up 45 percent of likely voters, the same number as supporters. But among non-voters, supporters outnumbered critics by 55 to 32 percent. It could not be more clear: Consistently motivating voters who support government action is absolutely crucial for the future of progressive politics. 
I should be clear: I am not arguing that nothing else matters. Scher asks, “[W]hy should Democrats prioritize junking what was just successfully defended, at enormous political risk, when there are so many other moral imperatives that warrant a robust and urgent policy response?” He mentions climate change, immigration reform, rebuilding infrastructure, etc. 
He’s not wrong. These and other issues are also vitally important. But Democrats aren’t likely to make headway on any of them nationally , without winning back power at least in the House in 2018 — with a few rare exceptions, such as the chance to turn DACA repeal into passage of the DREAM Act. What’s more, they are all connected ideologically by the belief that government is a vital part of the solution. So making that belief more salient, via Medicare for All advocacy — will help to advance them all. 
Democrats can and do walk and chew gum at the same time. They’ve been doing it for decades. It’s what their political culture is all about, as Grossman and Hopkins show in detail. What they haven’t been doing is clearly communicating about what they are doing in a way that reaches and mobilizes voters when it really counts. They lack a clear, coherent message that resonates across issue areas, and into people’s everyday lives. Medicare for All is not a unitary, quick-fix answer to that problem and no one should pretend it is. But it represents a clear path forward toward developing that message and nurturing the emergence of a new common sense. We’d be foolish not to take that path forward.

      <title>Britain&apos;s May says Trump visit still on despite terror tweets</title>
      <text>Britain&apos;s May says Trump visit still on despite terror tweets AFP 2 hrs ago © Provided by AFP US President Donald Trump&apos;s keenness to underline a series of terror attacks in Britain has drawn stern rebukes from Prime Minister Theresa May British Prime Minister Theresa May has insisted a long-awaited state visit by Donald Trump will go ahead as planned despite a diplomatic spat triggered by the US president&apos;s comments after a terror attack in London.
Speaking to ABC News from Downing Street in an interview that aired Sunday, she added that London was in talks with internet giants Google and Facebook about &quot;doing more&quot; to assist authorities in tracking extremists using the web to plan attacks, an issue she said she would take up at the UN General Assembly next week.
After an explosion in the London subway early Friday injured more than 20 people, Trump on Twitter blamed &quot;sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot;
Britons expressed outrage at the president&apos;s suggestion that British authorities had advance knowledge about the attackers. May herself told journalists Friday that &quot;I never think it&apos;s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.&quot;
Trump&apos;s keenness to underline a series of attacks in Britain has led to repeated outcry across the Atlantic that has helped indefinitely delay his much-vaunted state visit.
But in her ABC interview, May made clear the planned visit is still on.
&quot;Her Majesty the Queen issued the invitation,&quot; she said. &quot;The president has accepted it. It&apos;s just a question of getting dates to -- and sorting out the logistics.&quot;
May said the point of the historic &quot;special relationship&quot; between the two countries was that &quot;when we do disagree we&apos;re able to say so -- and pretty bluntly.&quot;
As an example, she cited the sharp differences over the Paris climate change agreement. &quot;I&apos;ve made very clear I was dismayed when America decided to pull out of that,&quot; she said, adding that she hoped the US administration would be &quot;able to find a way for America to come back into the agreement.&quot;
After reports that some European officials believed the US might return to the agreement, the White House said Saturday that it would do so only if it could negotiate more favorable terms.
May also emphasized the need to block terrorists from using the internet for planning attacks and &quot;for the spread of extremism, of hatred, of propaganda.&quot;
She said British authorities were working with internet giants like Facebook and Google &quot;about doing more.&quot;
Those companies and others, including YouTube and Twitter, have formed a Global Internet Forum to Combat Terrorism, working with governments and other groups.
Asked, if she agreed with a tweet from Trump urging a tougher travel ban to curb terrorism, May said, &quot;I think what is important is that we&apos;re able to have the powers to look into people, to identify people who may be wanting to cause us harm.&quot; And then to act accordingly.</text>

      <text>Trump Jr. Should Testify Under Oath on Russia, Feinstein Says By President’s son may be called to panel in fall, senator says Former Trump campaign manager also faces likely subpoena

President Donald Trump’s eldest son, Donald Jr., should testify under oath to a Senate panel investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. 
Parrying questions on Russia, North Korea and other subjects, the veteran senator said she wouldn’t discuss plans for a possible run in 2018 for a fifth term. 
Trump Jr. spoke for five hours behind closed doors to committee staff on Sept. 7, discussing his June 2016 meeting in New York with several Russians. At the time, Trump Jr. said in a prepared statement that he set up the meeting because he was interested in potentially damaging information about his father’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. 
“It’s Senator Grassley’s intent and it’s certainly my intent to have him before the committee in the open, and be able to ask some questions under oath,” Feinstein said on CNN’s “State of the Union,” referring to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. She said that’s likely to occur “this fall.” 
Feinstein said the committee also is likely to subpoena Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, after he has declined to voluntarily appear before Congress. Grassley said last week that Manafort’s lawyers aren’t returning the committee’s phone calls. 
Before Manafort does testify, though, the committee needs to “do some investigative work,” said Feinstein, adding that two new investigators have been hired to work with the Democratic side of the committee. The Senate investigation, marked by comity between the Republican and Democratic members, will take time, she said. ‘Be Patient’ 
“This could take a year, a year and a half if not more,” Feinstein said. “People need to be patient.” 
Feinstein, 84, said she wasn’t going to announce at this time whether she planned to run for another six-year term in 2018. She’s been a senator since 1992 and is the oldest current serving senator. “We’ll see,” she said. Grassley, who’s a few months younger than Feinstein, easily won reelection in 2016. 
Determining what role Russia had in trying to influence the outcome of the presidential election is the subject of investigations by both houses of Congress as well as by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the former FBI director. 
In addition to trying to learn more about that June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, focus has turned to divisive ads placed on widely-used social media platforms, likely by Russians. 
Congressman Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said panels members are seeking “a lot more information” from Facebook Inc. about $100,000 worth of ads spent there. ‘Aiming to Divide’ 
“When you look at the content of those ads, it really underscores what the intelligence community said earlier,” Schiff said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”“The Russians were really aiming to divide us, to sew discord, to effectively set one American against another on some of the most divisive issues that we have.” 
Schiff said he was “distressed” it took so long for investigators to be told of the ads and there are “a lot of unanswered questions.” 
“We need to know the full extent of their use of social media to influence us, from Facebook, from Twitter, from Google, from any social media or search engine,” Schiff said. “They need to be fully forthcoming, and I’m confident they will. I think, frankly they need to come and testify before Congress because there’s a lot we need to know about this.” 
Feinstein said there’s no indication at this time that the digital data operation effort during the election campaign, partially spearheaded by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, had any role in the Facebook ads.

      <title>There’s nothing funny about Trump’s troubling policing edicts</title>
      <text>Opinion There’s nothing funny about Trump’s troubling policing edicts Attorney General Jeff Sessions acknowledges applause at the Fraternal Order of Police convention Monday, Aug. 28, 2017, in Nashville, Tenn. Sessions said President Donald Trump will revive a program that provides local police departments with surplus military equipment such as high-caliber weapons and grenade launchers. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) By Steven Greenhut 17, 2017 at 9:13 am 17, 2017 at 9:20 am SACRAMENTO – During a July speech to police in Long Island, Donald Trump joked that when officers “put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head” that “you can take the hand away, OK?”
Many of the cops laughed approvingly, but civil liberties groups – and even some law-enforcement officials – were upset that the president made light of police brutality, especially given some troubling nationally publicized incidents.
Trump’s defenders argued that he was only joking about the treatment of killers, and that the rest of us need to lighten up. Didn’t Ronald Reagan joke about bombing Russia as he prepared for a radio address? Well, yes. But those arguments aren’t persuasive given that the administration’s actual policing policies seem likely to encourage abusive police behavior in a variety of ways.
Even the Republican-controlled House of Representatives seems to understand that point. On Tuesday, the House overwhelmingly approved amendments to a spending bill that try to limit the U.S. Justice Department’s efforts to let police officers expand the use of a policy known as “civil asset forfeiture.” Some forms of forfeiture have been around for centuries, but it really ramped up in the early days of the drug war, with policies designed to let police grab property and proceeds from major drug enterprises.
Like most government programs, it expanded beyond recognition. It’s turned into an astoundingly abusive process by which police seize the property of people who have never been convicted – or even accused – of a crime. In 2012 in Anaheim, federal authorities tried to seize a $1.5 million commercial building from its owner after one of his tenants, a medical-marijuana clinic, was accused of selling $37 in marijuana to an undercover cop. The feds eventually dropped the case amid blistering media coverage, but it shows how seriously this power can be abused.
Many states, including California, have passed laws requiring police agencies to gain a conviction (in most cases) before taking a person’s property. To get around those laws, local cops would “partner” with federal agencies and then operate under looser federal standards. After the property was taken, the local and federal folks would divvy up the proceeds – and then use the money to bolster their departmental budgets.
Two Justice Department officials who helped start the program in the 1980s later argued that the process “has turned into an evil itself, with the corruption it engendered among government and law enforcement coming to clearly outweigh any benefits.” The recent House vote seeks to block Attorney General Jeff Sessions from overturning Obama administration rules that put a few limits on these local-federal partnerships.
In another example of the administration’s lax attitude toward abusive government practices, Sessions last month decided to restore a federal program that provided rocket launchers, tank-like vehicles and other military gear to local cops. Police departments are supposed to protect and serve the community, not behave like an occupying army.
Before the last administration reined it in, the military acquisition program had gotten out of hand. A San Diego school district received a $730,000 mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) surplus vehicle from the military. Before they were pressured to return it, school officials said, “There will be medical supplies in the vehicle. There will be teddy bears in the vehicle.” Oh please. What kind of uprising are these police departments and school security offices trying to subdue?
Years ago, one official told me that his department eschewed high-powered equipment. That’s because once the agencies have new toys, they want to use them – even in situations where community policing operations are more appropriate. The equipment encourages police-state tactics. Yet the Trump administration thinks this is a good idea.
Newsweek reported that Sessions in June “submitted a letter asking certain members of Congress to remove federal protections that prevent the Department of Justice from cracking down on medical marijuana patients, cultivators and dispensaries that are in line with state law.”
Conservatives often talk about their fealty to the U.S. Constitution. But the 10th Amendment says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” States clearly have the right to set marijuana policy, yet the feds want to crack down on clinics anyway. Like it or not, California’s voters legalized medical marijuana in 1996.
Don’t bother arguing that these “law and order” policies are only about the “rule of law.” The president last month pardoned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had been convicted of criminal contempt, a misdemeanor, for defying a judge’s order that his department stop “detaining persons for further investigation without reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is being committed,” according to the verdict.
There’s a clear message from the pardon and from the president’s actions regarding asset forfeiture, police militarization and the drug war: Law enforcement has more latitude now to bend and break the rules. That certainly is no laughing matter.

      <text>DODD: America an ideological jumble LINDON DODD | Local Columnist Sep 16, 2017 
Lindon Dodd 
“Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that’s my goal, too. I want to bring everything crashing down and destroy all of today’s establishment.” 
— Former White House Chief-of-Staff Steve Bannon 
It’s not often I know I am writing a column that is sure to irritate almost everybody. It will agitate conservatives and liberals and probably amaze almost anyone who personally knows me. It’s kind of a gift I have. 
I am actually going to write something positive about President Donald J. Trump. 
After being somewhat stunned to hear he worked with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to get a temporary budget extension as of my writing this column, it appears that some kind of deal is in the works for the DACA issue. This will probably mean that 800,000 young people who only know America as their home even though they are undocumented illegal immigrants might not be arrested and sent back to a country they don’t know. 
For those of you who are not fuming at me yet, I will say how proud I am that the President seems to have taken just a relatively short time to decide that the art of compromise is the only way to get things done in Washington, D.C., and that is certainly better than the usual stalemate that has been present for so many years. 
Social media is full of left wing nuts and radical right-winged conservatives both sides of whom have felt their way the only way. Truth is the country is full of people across every ideological divide and not one group of ideologues should have their views naturally superlative over the other. In the immortal words of Rodney King, “Can we all just get along?” 
There is nothing like a Donald Trump compliment to fire up the left or a Rodney King quote to get my right-wing friends temperature up a degree or two. 
Recently on social media I have had debates with both sides by which I mean daily Trump bashers and the won’t let it go Obama haters club. I found it horrible to have to see the Obama hating daily slams as much as I do the current Trump haters. Neither Obama nor Trump would have been or will be the end of America. Like a bad coach on a good team or the occasional bad (fill in your profession of choice) institutions survive any one person or administration. 
From this week I will say that Donald Trump has impressed me. Who knows after next week or even the next tweet? I see hope that we might actually get something done in D.C. I am sure I will disagree with many things that the Trump administration does in the future. I didn’t agree with everything Obama did, Clinton did, Reagan did, and almost nothing that Dubya Bush did. However, I still didn’t spend every waking moment and commentary bashing them. 
Donald Trump has already performed an exorcism of conservative scary radicals like Steve Bannon. 
I usually find that most of the really vocal criticism of any president comes loudest from people who have never run or been in charge of anything in their life. This country is not made up just of white rednecks, angry blacks, middle class moderates, militant obstructionists, apathetic citizenry, or just plain regular folk who accept things as they come. America is made up of all of them and more. There is no one American. There is no single ideology. There is not a singular group of people who should get everything they want because that is how they want it to be. 
And just because you voted for Trump with a political agenda or very narrow ideology, does that mean he has to follow your individual political leanings to the tee? 
Some Obama loyalists will always hate Trump. Some Trump loyalists will continue to bash Obama. With some people this is an obsession. However, the country’s business will go on and it has to be dealt with in some ways in a bi-partisan manner. The irony of what I have observed for the last several presidencies is that both sides are equally as ungracious, nasty and obnoxious when their vote did not go the way they wanted. They are mirror images of each other. 
That is the very nature of Democracy. Sometimes you win and sometimes the other side wins. 
To the victor go some spoils, but like Reagan and Clinton both discovered, if the opposites work together to try and meet somewhere in between, some problems can be solved and some progress made. I am not yet a Trump fan who is converted, but I will give credit where credit is due. 
I will close for now, go into hiding, and await my hate emails.

      <title>California Lawmakers Approve Landmark ‘Sanctuary State’ Bill</title>
      <text>State Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-Los Angeles, speaks in support of a pair of environmental measures before the Senate, Friday, in Sacramento, Calif. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli) SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Los Angeles Times/TNS) - California lawmakers on Saturday passed a “sanctuary state” bill to protect immigrants without legal residency in the U.S., part of a broader push by Democrats to counter expanded deportation orders under the Trump administration.
The legislation by Democratic Sen. Kevin de Leon, the most far-reaching of its kind in the country, would limit state and local law enforcement communication with federal immigration authorities, and prevent officers from questioning and holding people on immigration violations.
After passionate debate in both houses of the Legislature, staunch opposition from Republican sheriffs and threats from Trump administration officials against sanctuary cities, Senate Bill 54 was approved Saturday by a 27-11 vote along party lines. But the bill sent to Gov. Jerry Brown drastically scaled back the version first introduced, the result of tough negotiations between Brown and De Leon in the final weeks of the legislative session.
The decision came hours after a federal judge in Chicago blocked the Trump administration’s move to withhold Justice Department grant funds to discourage so-called sanctuary city policies.
On the Senate floor minutes before 2 a.m. on Saturday, De Leon said the changes were reasonable, and reflected a powerful compromise between law enforcement officials and advocates.
“These amendments do not mean to erode the core mission of this measure, which is to protect hardworking families that have contributed greatly to our culture and the economy,” he said. “This is a measure that reflects the values of who we are as a great state.”
Officially dubbed the California Values Act, the legislation initially would have prohibited state and local law enforcement agencies from using any resources to hold or question people or share information about them with federal immigration agents unless they had violent or serious criminal convictions.
After talks with Brown, amendments to the bill made last week would allow federal immigration authorities to keep working with state corrections officials and to continue entering county jails to question immigrants. The legislation would also permit police and sheriffs to share information and transfer people to immigration authorities if they have been convicted of one or more crimes from a list of 800 outlined in a previous law, the California Trust Act.
Some immigrant rights advocates who were previously disappointed with the list of offenses under the Trust Act were dismayed to see the same exceptions applied in the so-called sanctuary state bill. The list includes many violent and serious crimes, as well as some nonviolent charges and “wobblers,” offenses that can be charged as a felony or misdemeanor, which advocates said has the potential to ensnare people who do not pose a danger to the public.
But immigrant rights groups did not withdraw their support for Senate Bill 54 and also won some concessions. Under the additions to the bill, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation would have to develop new standards to protect people held on immigration violations, and to allow immigrant inmates to receive credits toward their sentences serviced if they undergo rehabilitation and educational programs while incarcerated.
The state attorney general’s office would have to develop recommendations that limit immigration agents’ access to personal information. The attorney general also has broad authority under the state Constitution to ensure that police and sheriffs agencies follow SB 54’s provisions should it be signed into law.
“This was a hard-fought effort, but the end product was worth the fight,” Jennie Pasquarella, immigrants’ rights director with the American Civil Liberties Union of California, said in a statement Saturday.
The compromise helped draw support for the bill from Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, and moved the California Police Chiefs Association’s official position from opposed to neutral. The California Sheriffs Association remained opposed.
In a statement Saturday, Thomas Homan, acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said California politicians had “chosen to prioritize politics over public safety.”
“This bill severely undermines that effort and will make California communities less safe,” said Homan, who hosted a March town hall with Republican Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones on immigration enforcement that erupted in protests.
In their respective chambers Friday, at least 20 members of the Assembly and six members of the Senate took the floor for debate on the bill, voicing complex stances on illegal immigration, federalism and the diversity of families in California.
GOP Assemblyman Steven Choi, a first-generation immigrant from South Korea, said that he came to the U.S. legally and that the bill created “chaos” for a country built on law and order.
Others pointed to the opposition from sheriffs organizations, saying the bill would tie officers’ hands, allowing serial thieves, chronic drug abusers and gang members to slip through the cracks. Supporters countered the Trump administration was trying to paint all immigrants in the country illegally as criminals.
They pointed to provisions in the bill that would make hospitals, schools and courthouses safe zones for immigrants from federal immigration authorities at a time of fear for some communities.
“We are ironically ending this session the way we started, talking about protecting the most vulnerable among us,” Sen. Ricardo Lara, a Democrat, said.
De Leon introduced SB 54 on what was an unusually acrimonious first day of the 2017 legislative session, as lawmakers in both chambers were locked in bitter debate over the still newly elected President Donald Trump.
It was at the center of a legislative package filed by Democrats in an attempt to protect more than 2.3 million people living in the state illegally. Other legislative proposals and budget deals have expanded workplace protections against raids from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and increased legal defense services for immigrants facing deportation and financial aid for students without legal residency.
Senate Bill 54 received national attention as the U.S. Department of Justice pledged to slash government grants for law enforcement from any so-called sanctuary cities, which limit the collaboration between local and federal authorities on immigration enforcement.
In a statement Saturday, Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley said “state lawmakers inexplicably voted today to return criminal aliens back onto our streets.”
“This abandonment of the rule of law by the Legislature continues to put Californians at risk, and undermines national security and law enforcement,” he said.
At the request of the California Senate this year, former U.S. Attorney General Eric H Holder Jr. reviewed the bill and said it passed constitutional muster, adding that the states “have the power over the health and safety of their residents and allocation of state resources.”
Still, debate raged on and divided even law enforcement officials and associations. In Los Angeles, Police Chief Charlie Beck voiced his support, while L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell was a vocal opponent.
In a statement Saturday, McDonnell said the final version of the bill was not perfect, but “reflects much of what the LASD implemented years ago and the work is well underway.”
On Friday, lawmakers said some children without legal status were too afraid to go to school, while police statistics showed a drop in reports of violence as immigrant victims refused to come forward.
Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia said the era was reminiscent of the 1980s, when her father dreaded immigration raids.
“We are not living in a hypothetical fear,” she said. “That fear is a reality.”</text>

      <title>Did Google censor autosuggest results for Hillary Clinton?</title>
      <text>Google&apos;s own statement to The Washington Times explains the underlying issue: 
Our Autocomplete algorithm will not show a predicted query that is offensive or disparaging when displayed in conjunction with a person’s name. More generally, our autocomplete predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms 
and as much as their own words are worth in this context they also explicitly disavow Google Autocomplete favoring a specific candidate or cause 
Google Autocomplete does not favor any candidate or cause 
Secondly there is an issue where people searching for negative things about Hillary Clinton use &apos;Hillary X&apos;, not &apos;Hillary Clinton X&apos;, as noted on Twitter by Matt Cutts, a Google Employee ( compare autocomplete results for &apos;Hillary in&apos; and &apos;Hillary Clinton in&apos;). 
And lastly it&apos;s possible to compare it to Donald Trump autocomplete results as is done by Rhea Drysdale 
Donald Trump was accused of rape by Ivana Trump during their divorce. She has since disavowed this, but it’s a real story in the news and many have searched for it. Interestingly, a Google search for “Donald Trump ra-” does not return anything about the rape. There are many mentions of “rally,” which makes sense, but “Donald Trump rap” has less trending searches in the last year and ranks where as “Donald Trump rape” does not. Search trends are a significant factor in how Google Autocomplete works — this is the entire basis for SourceFed’s claim and yet according to their logic, Google must be favoring Donald Trump as well.</text>

      <title>Trump hypes mock video of golf ball seen striking Clinton</title>
      <text>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump has retweeted a mock video that shows him striking a golf ball that — in the next frame — seemingly hits Hillary Clinton in the back and knocks her down as she boards a plane. The re-edited video appears to be a doctored version of news footage from 2011 […]</text>

      <title>Comment on Clark: There are many lapses in Nigeria’s constitution by muazu wali</title>

Elder statesman and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Robert Clark, has called for a review of the Nigerian constitution to reflect the number of days a President should spend outside the country before he can be declared incapable to govern. Speaking on a radio programme The Discourse with Jimi Disu, Chief Clark said there is a lacuna in the current constitution. “Section 145 of the Nigerian Constitution which says that when the President wants to go on a vacation or a sick leave, he needs to send a letter to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the house in which he would make his intentions clear does not cover such cases. The section says that when the President is on such leave, there is no time limit to the time he can spend and no one has the power to tell him when to return. “He decides when he wants to return. That is the lacuna because one can envisage a situation where three months after he gets into office the President can be off for three years and the law permits it.” “It is lacuna we have to look into via constitution amendment to put time limit to it. The provision we had during the tenure of President Umaru Yar Adua was that when the President was incapacitated, then the cabinet will call a meeting and ask that a medical examination be carried out on him. He lamented that that was why the Federal Executive Council could summon such meeting in 2010, “none of them had the effrontery to do it when President Yar’Adua could no longer perform his duties. No one in his cabinet or his kitchen cabinet could do that. I think it was the late Prof. Dora Akunyili, the then Minister of Information who summoned the courage to speak on the issue. He said this man could not perform his duties hence let us get up and do something” “In America today, even among the Republicans, even Donald Trump can be declared insane or something. And if that arises, they will use that section which they have and which we also have in our constitution to remove him. But outside that there is no other provision. As it is now, he could spend 100 or 200 days without breeching the law. It is only when he feels he is capable to come back that he will and he will inform the National Assembly that he can resume.” He said until the constitution is amended the situation will remain the same. “It is either we put a limit to the absence or we change the law to show that if he is absent from office for more than a certain months then certain things will have to happen.” On the recent controversy over the statement made by the Minister of Women Affairs, Aisha Alhassan where she said she will support former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar in the 2019 elections, while still serving under Muhammad Buhari, Chief Clark said that the minister has not broken any law. “But morally, you owe your appointer an allegiance. We can only talk about your allegiance to the country when your appointer is doing something that violates the laws of the land or that can impede the growth and development of the country. It is then you can say I can no longer be loyal to you, but to my country at this stage. Alhassan has not broken any law; morally she has done something against the norms of morality but not legality Asked whether she should be sacked, he said there is no need for that especially if she is doing her job very well as minister. Clark said her feelings about supporting Atiku in still ahead that is in 2019. Drawing a parallel between that and a situation where a lawyer in his chambers does such, he said he would sit such lawyer down and ask for explanations with the view to learning from him, because he would want to know whether it was in his areas of intolerance or something, adding though that it is an individual matter. On plans to criminalise hate speech, he said the Nigerian Constitution provides for freedom of expression, but that such freedom stops where such speech will incites people of negative reaction or cause disruption. Chief Clark said: “If I sit with you in my office and said a particular tribe is this or that, it is not hate speech, but if I go to a public square to make such statement before 20 or 30 people, then it becomes a hate speech, because I am trying to incite people.”“You see the crime in hate speech is any act or speech that will incite the public to do something illegal or criminal; we have that law. However, there is nothing in our law now that condemns or classifies anything as hate speech, but we have laws against defamation,” he said. Share this:</text>

      <title>Floyd Mayweather Jr. Defends Trump, Slams Leftists, Ungrateful Immigrants</title>
      <text>Floyd Mayweather Jr. Defends Trump, Slams Leftists, Ungrateful Immigrants Floyd Mayweather Jr. Defends Trump, Slams Leftists, Ungrateful Immigrants By 
Truth Revolt September 17, 2017 
The following interview didn’t receive much fanare in the mainstream media, and it’s no wonder why. 
Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. gave a lengthy interview Monday to Hollywood Unlocked . While much of what Mayweather spoke about concerned boxing, he also took time to share his views on President Trump — namely that people have judged him unfairly. 
A portion of the interview is featured above (warning: strong language) and the The Daily Wire summarized other pertinent parts of the boxer’s interview: 
I think a lot, within this world, like I said, racism still exists. You never heard anything about Donald Trump being racist until he ran for president and won. Before that, everyone was like, “Oh, he on WWE. He on different shows.” Everybody, they liked Donald Trump. As soon as he ran for president, because, people don’t like the truth. 
Mayweather also dismissed news media apoplexy over the released Access Hollywood (“grab her by the p****”) tape: 
He speak like a real man spoke. Real man speak, like, “Man, she had a fat a**. Did you see that a**? I had to squeeze her a**. I had to grab that fat a**.” Right? 
So, he talkin’ locker room talk. You know what I’m sayin’? “I’m the man. You know me, I grabbed her by the p****. And?” 
I feel people shy away from realness. This man didn’t do nothin’. Hey, listen. If y’all didn’t want the man in the White House, y’all should’ve voted the other way. He didn’t rob, he done his homework. He done what he had to do and he got there. I’m not here to knock nobody. 
With regard to other policies Trump critics are protesting, Mayweather’s advice is simple: focus on yourself. All the time you spend protesting could be spent coming up with ideas for a business! Amen: 
So at the end of the day, I don’t know why everybody keeps bitching about, and keeps picketing, and…</text>

      <title>Trump hypes mock video of golf ball seen striking Clinton</title>
      <text>Find us on Twitter Trump hypes mock video of golf ball seen striking Clinton Hillary Rodham Clinton signs copies of her book &quot;What Happened&quot; at a book store in New York, Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2017. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)   03:24 pm 
WASHINGTON &#x97; President Donald Trump took another swing at Hillary Clinton in the latest sign that his campaign fury hasn&apos;t faded, retweeting a mock video that shows him smacking a golf ball that &#x97; in the next frame &#x97; seemingly strikes her in the back before she stumbles and falls down while boarding a plane. 
Trump retweeted the brief video on his official Twitter account early Sunday, which appears to be a doctored version of news footage from 2011 that shows the then-secretary of state falling after climbing the airplane stairs. The re-edited video appears to have superimposed images of a golf ball that is shown hitting Clinton. 
The tweet says: &quot;Donald Trump&apos;s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary.&quot; 
A Clinton spokesman declined comment. The White House issued no immediate comment, and Trump aides have said in the past that his tweets &quot;speak for themselves.&quot; The assessment from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: &quot;juvenile.&quot; 
Back in July, Trump vented his rage against the media by posting someone else&apos;s doctored anti-CNN video that showed Trump pummeling a man in a business suit &#x97; the man&apos;s face obscured by the CNN logo &#x97; outside a wrestling ring. 
Trump has stepped up his criticism of Clinton since the Democratic presidential nominee re-emerged in the spotlight to promote her new book about the 2016 campaign. She is unsparing in her assessment of Trump, calling him &quot;a clear and present danger to the country and the world.&quot; 
Trump often cites his electoral vote victory as evidence of campaign prowess and popularity with Americans. He is quick to challenge or criticize anyone or anything that might undercut that premise. Trump has established a commission to investigate his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally in 2016, when Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes. 
&quot;It is distressing though to have a president that, frankly, will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that,&quot; Schiff said on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; Sunday. &quot;It doesn&apos;t help, I think, in terms of his stature. It doesn&apos;t help in terms of the stature of our whole country.&quot; 
Clinton&apos;s book assigns blame for her presidential loss on several factors, including interference from Russian hackers, accusations leveled at her by former FBI Director James Comey and even her gender. The White House has criticized the book, with spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it &quot;sad&quot; that the last chapter of Clinton&apos;s public life will be defined by selling books with &quot;false and reckless attacks.&quot; 
In a pair of tweets last week, Trump took direct aim at Clinton. 
&quot;Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!&quot; Trump wrote. 
Referring to Clinton&apos;s past description of some Trump supporters, he later tweeted: &quot;The &apos;deplorables&apos; came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!&quot;

      <title>Top US diplomat says closing Embassy in Cuba &apos;under review&apos;</title>
      <text>Find us on Twitter Top US diplomat says closing embassy in Cuba &apos;under review&apos; FILE - In this Aug. 14, 2015, file photo, a U.S. flag flies at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba. U.S. investigators are chasing many theories about what&apos;s harming American diplomats in Cuba, including a sonic attack, electromagnetic weapon or flawed spying device. (AP Photo/Desmond Boylan, File)  03 pm 
NEW YORK &#x97; The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday. 
Tillerson&apos;s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after a half-century of estrangement. 
&quot;We have it under evaluation,&quot; Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. &quot;It&apos;s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We&apos;ve brought some of those people home. It&apos;s under review.&quot; 
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims &#x97; diplomats and their families &#x97; some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported . 
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential &quot;sonic attack.&quot; Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. 
Tillerson once called the events &quot;health attacks,&quot; but the State Department has since used the term &quot;incidents&quot; while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn&apos;t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it&apos;s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter. 
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected. 
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn&apos;t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. 
A decision to shutter the embassy, even temporarily, would deal a demoralizing blow to the delicate detente that President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro announced in late 2014. The next year, embassies were reopened and restrictions on travel and commerce eased &#x97; signs of a warming relationship that displeased some hard-liners in Cuba&apos;s government. President Donald Trump has reversed some of the changes, but left many in place. 
Tillerson spoke on CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week. 
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it&apos;s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit. 
The U.S. hasn&apos;t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn&apos;t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba&apos;s security services might be involved. 
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States &#x97; a move with dramatic diplomatic implications 
&quot;Cuba&apos;s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,&quot; said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who led the effort, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American and critic of the U.S. detente. 
The incidents have frightened Havana&apos;s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.

      <title>What Happened by Hillary Clinton</title>
      <text>Even Seth Meyers took to Late Night to tell Hillary she was in the wrong about blaming Sanders.
As for Putin, Clinton writes that he had a &quot;personal vendetta against me and deep resentment toward the United States&quot;.
&quot;They don&apos;t have to buy it&quot;, he told TIME in a brief interview at the United Nations Thursday. &quot;I wish it were that easy but it&apos;s not&quot;.
Forget yesterday&apos;s news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email . Her new memoir on the campaign and subsequent defeat is called &quot; What Happened &quot;. Bill Austin, the founder of the Starkey Hearing Foundation, which has partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative on this issue, was the other keynote speaker, and Barbara Bush, the daughter of former President George W. Bush, was on the panel as a moderator.
&quot;This was a highly sophisticated influence operation&quot;, Clinton said.
&quot;If you didn&apos;t like that book, try this one - some good lessons in here about working together to solve problems&quot;, she tweeted .
We all know she had to have been thinking it. But now, she&apos;s outright saying it on television!
Nouveau festival offensif de Manchester City à Watford
Liverpool manque de son côté une belle opportunité en ne faisant pas mieux qu&apos;un match nul 1-1 à Anfield face à Burnley. La réussite offensive de Manchester City doit laisser rêveur Jürgen Klopp, le manager de Liverpool.
Hillary Clinton and President Donald Trump continued to re-litigate the 2016 election.
&quot;That stopped my momentum, and it really caused enough people to move away from me&quot;.
She&apos;s been making the rounds in the US to promote her new book and is being refreshingly honest about the behind the scenes of the campaign, as well as her personal feelings.
As columnist Doyle McManus asked in a recent column for the Los Angeles Times, &quot;Was this book necessary?&quot;
The former Secretary of State and First Lady&apos;s response immediately triggered a barrage of tweets and memes with many praising her for the &quot;hilarious&quot; and &quot;perfect clap back&quot;.
&quot;I respect the fact that he is the president&quot;.
Wow. Will Trump take her up on the offer?

      <title>Clinton On Hindering New Democratic Voices: &quot;I Don&apos;t Buy That At All&quot;</title>
      <text>She told Trump via Twitter that if he didn&apos;t like her new book, perhaps he should read her other literary work, &quot; It Takes a Village &quot; - which by the way, is a picture book for children. &quot;She lost the debates and lost her direction!&quot;
The illustration accompanies editor David Remnick&apos;s article &quot; Hillary Clinton Looks Back in Anger &quot;.
US President Donald Trump renewed his Twitter feud with his former election rival Hillary Clinton this week over her election loss and took aim at her newly released memoir What Happened . I was focused on the technical details, getting the face just right, and on the layout.
L&apos;Atlético gagne dans son nouveau stade — Liga
Après un beau numéro côté droit signé Correa, &quot;Grizou&quot; a parfaitement repris le centre de l&apos;Argentin pour trouver la faille (61e). Après ses prouesses au Vicente-Calderon, le buteur tricolore garde ses bonnes habitudes au Wanda Metropolitano.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signs copies of her new book &quot;What Happened&quot; during a book signing event at Barnes and Noble bookstore September 12, 2017 in New York City. Democrats don&apos;t need to question their own assumptions and prescriptions. &quot;I think there&apos;s a lot of evidence, a lot of research supporting the idea that race is a much more motivating factor for others than gender is&quot;. We did not understand how a reality TV campaign would so dominate the media environment. But Trump won the Electoral College, an organization of 538 members who choose the President based on the favorable vote in each state to assert the fact that an individual who receives most votes nationally doesn&apos;t undoubtedly win the election.
Gone are about 900 reviews that Amazon has deemed to be unreliable, as of this time. Barbara Boxer proposed a bill to abolish the system in the wake of Trump&apos;s victory. It has outlets like Breitbart and crazy Infowars, and things like that. Organizer say Clinton will talk about her thoughts on the 2016 presidential campaign.

      <title>Trump hypes mock video of golf ball seen striking Clinton</title>
      <text>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump took another swing at Hillary Clinton in the latest sign that his campaign fury hasn&apos;t faded, retweeting a mock video that shows him smacking a golf ball that — in the next frame — seemingly strikes her in the back before she stumbles and falls down while boarding a plane.
Trump retweeted the brief video on his official Twitter account early Sunday, which appears to be a doctored version of news footage from 2011 that shows the then-secretary of state falling after climbing the airplane stairs. The re-edited video appears to have superimposed images of a golf ball that is shown hitting Clinton.
The tweet says: &quot;Donald Trump&apos;s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary.&quot;
A Clinton spokesman declined comment. The White House issued no immediate comment, and Trump aides have said in the past that his tweets &quot;speak for themselves.&quot; The assessment from Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.: &quot;juvenile.&quot;
Back in July, Trump vented his rage against the media by posting someone else&apos;s doctored anti-CNN video that showed Trump pummeling a man in a business suit — the man&apos;s face obscured by the CNN logo — outside a wrestling ring.
Trump has stepped up his criticism of Clinton since the Democratic presidential nominee re-emerged in the spotlight to promote her new book about the 2016 campaign. She is unsparing in her assessment of Trump, calling him &quot;a clear and present danger to the country and the world.&quot; Paul Walsh
Trump often cites his electoral vote victory as evidence of campaign prowess and popularity with Americans. He is quick to challenge or criticize anyone or anything that might undercut that premise. Trump has established a commission to investigate his unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally in 2016, when Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 2.9 million votes.
&quot;It is distressing though to have a president that, frankly, will tweet and retweet things as juvenile as that,&quot; Schiff said on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week&quot; Sunday. &quot;It doesn&apos;t help, I think, in terms of his stature. It doesn&apos;t help in terms of the stature of our whole country.&quot;
Clinton&apos;s book assigns blame for her presidential loss on several factors, including interference from Russian hackers, accusations leveled at her by former FBI Director James Comey and even her gender. The White House has criticized the book, with spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it &quot;sad&quot; that the last chapter of Clinton&apos;s public life will be defined by selling books with &quot;false and reckless attacks.&quot;
In a pair of tweets last week, Trump took direct aim at Clinton.
&quot;Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!&quot; Trump wrote.
Referring to Clinton&apos;s past description of some Trump supporters, he later tweeted: &quot;The &apos;deplorables&apos; came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!&quot;</text>

      <text>McMaster: Trump could keep US in climate accord with deal ‘that benefits the American people’   11:03 am 
ABC News (WASHINGTON) — White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said President Donald Trump could decide to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate accord if there is a better agreement that benefits the American people. 
ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos asked McMaster in an interview on This Week Sunday if it was possible that the U.S. may stay in the international climate accord. The Wall Street Journal on Saturday reported that the Trump administration was seeking to avoid withdrawal from the accord. 
“If there’s an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly,” McMaster told Stephanopoulos. 
In June, the president announced that the U.S. would exit the climate agreement, saying, “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.” 
Trump’s national security adviser said the president has been clear he is withdrawing the U.S. from the deal because it does not benefit the U.S., but would be open to re-entering the accord if a there is a better deal. 
“What the president has said is that we are withdrawing from the Paris accord. He left the door open to re-entering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States,” McMaster said. 
“The president’s objection to Paris is not that he’s against the environment or the climate,” McMaster said. “What the president wants is a more effective approach to energy and the climate.” 
McMaster was also asked about the president’s response to the London Underground terror attack Friday. After the attack, the president tweeted that the United States’ travel ban should be “far larger, tougher.” The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct! 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 
McMaster said the administration is “looking at” the issue. 
He said they’re looking at “how to protect the American people better, how to ensure that we know who these people are who are moving.”“If you can’t screen people effectively to know who’s coming into your country, then you shouldn’t allow people from that country to travel.” 
McMaster also addressed North Korea’s latest missile test and the United Nations Security Council’s approval of new sanctions against the regime. The president on Sept. 12 called the sanctions “not a big deal,” apparently questioning their potential effectiveness. 
“We all have our doubts about whether or not that’s going to be enough,” McMaster said of the UN action. “And so we have to prepare all options. We have to make sure all options are under development to ensure that this regime cannot threaten the world with a nuclear weapon,” he said. 
Trump tweeted Sunday morning that he spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last night and asked how “Rocket Man” is doing. 
I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad! 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017 

Stephanopoulos asked McMaster if “Rocket Man” refers to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
“It appears to be so. That is where the rockets and missiles are coming from, is North Korea,” he said.

      <text>McMaster: Trump could keep US in climate accord with deal ‘that benefits the American people’   9:50 am 
ABC News (WASHINGTON) -- White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said President Donald Trump could decide to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate accord if there is a better agreement that benefits the American people.ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos asked McMaster in an interview on This Week Sunday if it was possible that the U.S. may stay in the international climate accord. The Wall Street Journal on Saturday reported that the Trump administration was seeking to avoid withdrawal from the accord.&quot;If there’s an agreement that benefits the American people, certainly,&quot; McMaster told Stephanopoulos.In June, the president announced that the U.S. would exit the climate agreement, saying, &quot;I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.&quot;Trump’s national security adviser said the president has been clear he is withdrawing the U.S. from the deal because it does not benefit the U.S., but would be open to re-entering the accord if a there is a better deal.“What the president has said is that we are withdrawing from the Paris accord. He left the door open to re-entering at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States,” McMaster said.“The president’s objection to Paris is not that he’s against the environment or the climate,” McMaster said. “What the president wants is a more effective approach to energy and the climate.”McMaster was also asked about the president&apos;s response to the London Underground terror attack Friday. After the attack, the president tweeted that the United States&apos; travel ban should be &quot;far larger, tougher.&quot; The travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific-but stupidly, that would not be politically correct! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 
McMaster said the administration is &quot;looking at&quot; the issue.He said they&apos;re looking at &quot;how to protect the American people better, how to ensure that we know who these people are who are moving.&quot; &quot;If you can&apos;t screen people effectively to know who&apos;s coming into your country, then you shouldn&apos;t allow people from that country to travel.&quot;McMaster also addressed North Korea&apos;s latest missile test and the United Nations Security Council&apos;s approval of new sanctions against the regime. The president on Sept. 12 called the sanctions &quot;not a big deal,&quot; apparently questioning their potential effectiveness.&quot;We all have our doubts about whether or not that&apos;s going to be enough,&quot; McMaster said of the UN action. &quot;And so we have to prepare all options. We have to make sure all options are under development to ensure that this regime cannot threaten the world with a nuclear weapon,&quot; he said.Trump tweeted Sunday morning that he spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-in last night and asked how &quot;Rocket Man&quot; is doing. 
I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017 

Stephanopoulos asked McMaster if &quot;Rocket Man&quot; refers to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
&quot;It appears to be so. That is where the rockets and missiles are coming from, is North Korea,&quot; he said.

      <text>Stop talking, start building  

White House staffer Marc Short, formerly a Koch underling, recently told CNN that Americans should discuss &quot;what the definition of a wall is.&quot; 

Perhaps after doing so, we could wrangle over what the meaning of &quot;is&quot; is. 

During the 2016 campaign, and to the roared approval of arena throngs, nationwide, Donald Trump essayed no such lawyerly imposture. The promises he made during his campaign announcement were pledged anew throughout his successful effort. 

&quot;I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I&apos;ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I&apos;ll have Mexico pay for that wall.&quot; 

Establishment voices already hostile to the populist Trump Revolution that threatened their political and economic hegemony later  sought to mischaracterize the candidate&apos;s ambition as being one potentially satisfied by mere fencing. (A canard recalled by Short&apos;s quote.) 

Trump then reiterated his intention to build a true, physical wall, and not simply a fence (or &apos;virtual barrier&apos;). Citizen Free Press reports that on 9/14, he again stressed that vow in a message to CNN&apos;s Jeremy Diamond:  

&quot;There&apos;s been a lot of noise today, and a lot of rumors. Let me set the record straight in the simplest language possible...WE WILL BUILD A WALL (NOT A FENCE), ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES TO HELP STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND KEEP AMERICA SAFE. Apparently, liberals in congress and the mainstream media need one more reminder that building that wall is non-negotiable.&quot; 

Like many Trump supporters, I was attracted by his wall vow. I still believe it to be a fine idea with several benefits: Illegal immigration would be curtailed, the welfare of genuine American citizens would be protected, and our country&apos;s sovereign authority and independence from globalists&apos; dark designs would again be unmistakably asserted.  

But I do understand that the significance of erecting such a wall may now be less imperative than in 2016, given the reduction in illegal immigration. 

Regardless, in Marc Short&apos;s attempted obfuscation, perceptive listeners can detect an arrogant Swamp gurgle. Though it may not seem entirely presidential, I&apos;d advise that the Commander In Chief take Short for a trip to the good, old woodshed. </text>

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 12 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images Originally published on September 17, 2017 3:02 pm 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. © 2017 WWNO</text>

      <text>The tense political climate dividing America does not spare the classroom, as can be seen in a drama in Cherokee County. A few weeks ago, River Ridge High School math teacher Lyn Orletsky instructed two boys in her pre-calculus class to turn their “Make America Great Again” T-shirts inside out to conceal the slogan, which she felt had become divisive and even threatening. After teaching five years in Cherokee where nearly three out of four voters endorsed Donald Trump in November, Orletsky had seen many pro Trump shirts in the school.
But this was late August, two weeks after white supremacists and neo-Nazis embraced “Make America Great Again” as a rallying cry in Charlottesville, Va. A counterdemonstrator was killed and others injured when one of the marchers drove his car into a crowd. Orletsky feared the slogan would intimidate the minority students who were a third of her math class that period.
“I want everybody in that classroom to feel they are respected, and each should have their dignity … I have no problems with them wearing shirts in support of President Trump,” she said in an interview. “But I told the boys, in light of everything that has happened, I don’t think this is an appropriate slogan to be wearing at school.”
The boys asked what was wrong with the slogan. Orletsky said it had been co-opted by white supremacist movement, as the swastika had been by Nazis. A grainy student cellphone video , given to a conservative website, shows the conversation is calm, but she is resolute and the boys leave the classroom. The viral video has led to death threats and her removal from her classroom..
The incident did not immediately erupt into a media maelstrom. The boys went to the principal, who met with Orletsky and advised her that the shirts are permissible. The boys returned to class the next day before the high school broke for Labor Day weekend. And that is when the cellphone video went viral.
Over the holiday, Orletsky said her principal called her to ask if she was aware of the social media frenzy. Hundreds of emails included one from Oregon that threatened: “Lyn Orletsky, a math teacher at River Ridge High School in Woodstock, will DIE after what she has done … You and your liberal agenda’s have finally pushed us into a corner. Do you know what happens when a rabid dog feels trapped in a corner, he only has one option and that is to defend himself at all cost so it never happens again.”
As the rancor and volume accelerated, Orletsky said she saw a shift in the district’s attitude, and was put on administrative leave, where she remains. In a letter to parents, the principal wrote, “Ms. Orletsky is no longer your child’s math teacher, effective immediately.”
A district statement stated: “Her actions were wrong, as the ‘Make America Great Again’ shirts worn by the students are not a violation of our School District dress code. The teacher additionally — and inappropriately — shared her personal opinion about the campaign slogan during class.”
Now students are without a teacher who’s earned multiple teaching honors, including the highly regarded National Board Certification. At River Ridge, Orletsky teaches yoga to special-needs teenagers and advises the Interact Club, which performs community service. Woodstock parent Sharis Mayer was stunned Orletsky was taken from the classroom, calling her “the most important teacher my daughter ever had.” Her daughter is now a biomedical engineering major at Georgia Tech.
Recent River Ridge graduate Fariha Akter, 18, said she cannot recall Orletsky bringing up her political beliefs in class. Akter believes Orletsky was wrong to ask the students to change their shirts. But Akter said Muslim and black students at River Ridge have had negative comments directed at them with no similar sanctions. “It should not only be kids with Trump shirts who the school defends. Black and Muslim students in the school should also be defended.”
If the teacher believed some students saw the shirts as a threat, it seems wiser in retrospect to have talked first to the principal about the appropriate response before asking the boys to change. But does this rise to suspension or dismissal? For me, the incident merits dial-back and a sit-down with the students, teacher and principal. It ought to come down to intent. Was Orletsky trying to improve her classroom learning environment or impose her politics? There seems to be no evidence of the latter.
In fact, the Rev. Tripp Norris, an Episcopal priest and longtime Cherokee parent of a senior at River Ridge, said the viral video clip was edited and fails to show that other students in the class first raised the issue of the shirts with the boys.
“This started as a Facebook post and has become sabre rattling and hate speech,” Norris said. “It has turned into a vicious attack that is nowhere close to reality. What I said to the parents: What responsibility do the kids take for creating a disturbance?”</text>

      <title>11-Year-Old Mows The White House Lawn With President Trump Watching – Politics Video</title>
      <text>49 Comments Politics Video 
An 11-year-old boy who wrote to President Donald Trump asking if he could mow the White House lawn was granted his wish Friday. Frank Giaccio, who runs his own yard services business in Virginia, wrote to the president offering his skills, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders read out the letter at a White House press briefing last month. On Friday, he mowed the Rose Garden lawn while wearing goggles and ear protectors. Trump even came to congratulate the youngster on his skills.</text>

      <title>Top US diplomat says closing Embassy in Cuba ‘under review’</title>
      <text>by Josh Lederman,   11:14 am EDT Last   1:20 pm EDT 
NEW YORK, N.Y. – The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday. 
Tillerson’s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after a half-century of estrangement. 
“We have it under evaluation,” Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. “It’s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We’ve brought some of those people home. It’s under review.” 
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims — diplomats and their families — some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported . 
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential “sonic attack.” Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. 
Tillerson once called the events “health attacks,” but the State Department has since used the term “incidents” while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn’t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it’s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter. 
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected. 
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. 
A decision to shutter the embassy, even temporarily, would deal a demoralizing blow to the delicate detente that President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro announced in late 2014. The next year, embassies were reopened and restrictions on travel and commerce eased — signs of a warming relationship that displeased some hard-liners in Cuba’s government. President Donald Trump has reversed some of the changes, but left many in place. 
Tillerson spoke on CBS’“Face the Nation” as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week. 
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it’s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit. 
The U.S. hasn’t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn’t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba’s security services might be involved. 
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States — a move with dramatic diplomatic implications 
“Cuba’s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,” said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who led the effort, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American and critic of the U.S. detente. 
The incidents have frightened Havana’s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.

      <title>Donald Trump Retweets Joke About Violence Toward Hillary Clinton</title>
      <text>Donald Trump Retweets Joke About Violence Toward Hillary Clinton Amanda Terkel Tweet Share Then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks as then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton looks on during the final presidential debate on Oct. 19, 2016. More President Donald Trump shared a tweet Sunday morning that included the image of him hitting a golf ball and striking Hillary Clinton on the head. The tweet came from a user named @Fuctupmind, whose Twitter bio indicates that he wants Clinton to be in prison and believes the conspiracy theory that Democrats had something to do with the death of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich . Donald Trump&apos;s amazing golf swing #CrookedHillary pic.twitter.com/vKhxxFCBV1 — Mike (@Fuctupmind) September 14, 2017 It was not unusual to see violent and misogynistic imagery directed at Clinton at Trump rallies during the 2016 presidential campaign. Last week, Clinton noted that there was significant criticism directed toward comedian Kathy Griffin when she held up a fake decapitated head of Trump ― and added that she didn’t remember the same outcry over images of her. “We recently had this big kerfuffle ― this condemnation of Kathy Griffin ― for the picture she had of herself holding a head of Trump like a play on Perseus holding the head of Medusa,” Clinton said. “They were selling T-shirts and mugs at the Republican [National] Convention with Trump holding my head . Nobody said a word. Not a word!” HuffPost reporters never saw that specific image mentioned by Clinton, but we did see T-shirts of Trump punching out Clinton in a boxing ring and the Democratic presidential candidate falling off a motorcycle. It’s not unusual for Trump to retweet random accounts, occasionally including users who have anti-Semitic views . Want more updates from Amanda Terkel?

NEW YORK — The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday.
RELATED LINKS Ailments that plagued diplomats in Cuba puzzle investigators Average Cubans likely hurt by Trump’s return to stricter rules Tillerson’s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after roughly a half-century of estrangement.
“We have it under evaluation,” Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. “It’s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We’ve brought some of those people home. It’s under review.”
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims, some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported.
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential “sonic attack.” Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms.
Tillerson once called the events “health attacks,” but the State Department has since used the term “incidents” while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn’t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it’s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter.
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected.
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity.
Tillerson spoke on CBS’ “Face the Nation” as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week.
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it’s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit.
The U.S. hasn’t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn’t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba’s security services might be involved.
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States — a move with dramatic diplomatic implications
“Cuba’s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,” said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American, and the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas.
The incidents have frightened Havana’s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.

      <title>“Carpe diem politics”: How to do more than just resist</title>
      <text>SOURCE YES! Magazine TAGS carpe diem politics protest resist revolution Here’s something that might surprise you: One of the most powerful weapons we can use against far-right authoritarians like President Donald Trump has its roots in ancient philosophy. In particular, we can draw on the idea of carpe diem , or “seize the day,” a maxim penned by the Roman poet Horace. Let me explain.
Today we are living in an age of global political dissent that we haven’t seen since the 1960s. From the Umbrella Revolution in Hong Kong in 2014 to the Women’s March in Washington, D.C., and anti-Putin protests in Russia this year, people have been stepping onto the streets in unprecedented numbers in the past decade.
What unites so many of these social movements is that they embody what I call “carpe diem politics.” This is different from the conventional definition of the phrase, such as in the film Dead Poets Society , which is all about individuals making bold decisions in life. Rather, carpe diem politics involves grassroots movements taking the seize-the-day ideal from the individual up to the collective level to achieve radical change.
Using Horace’s phrase in a political context dates back at least to the Spanish Civil War, when it entered the popular lexicon among Republican forces seizing a revolutionary moment. That interpretation has been carried forward, and now is most associated with one of the best-known environmentalists, social justice bands in the United Kingdom, Seize the Day.
There are three aspects to the idea of carpe diem politics. First, it involves seizing opportunities on a mass scale that otherwise might be lost and disappear forever. Second, spontaneous mobilization cracks open the social order from below. A crucial third element is hedonistic revelry – a carnival spirit with dancing, music, costumes, and other forms of play.
Research I conducted for Carpe Diem: Seizing the Day in a Distracted World reveals that throughout history, effective movements (particularly, though not exclusively, those on the progressive democratic left) have tapped into all three elements. Think of the mass protests that helped bring down the Berlin Wall in 1989. They were seizing a political moment. It was full of spontaneous action and filled with hedonistic exuberance alongside very serious political intent. As historian Padraic Kenney put it, “What started as just a carnival became a revolution.”
The Occupy Movement was part of this tradition. In many cities it was not just the fire of social justice that galvanized protesters – it was also the carnival spirit of mass sing-alongs and dancing flash mobs that helped create and maintain such a strong sense of community.
I believe that protest movements today struggling against the likes of Trump – on issues ranging from climate change to women’s rights and immigration – will be more successful if they can draw on these three elements of carpe diem politics. But they face two key challenges.
First is the danger of mobilization without organization, creating what civil rights activist Angela Davis described in her book Abolition Democracy as “movements modeled after fast food delivery.” It’s not enough to use smart social media strategies to get people to pour spontaneously into the streets. Nothing beats the hard work of face-to-face community organizing (as the “barnstorming” of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign revealed).
Second, movements need to combine their seize-the-day strategies with clear and powerful policy aims. While Occupy had a huge impact inserting inequality into the political conversation, the absence of specific propositions (such as in the slogan “Occupy Everything, Demand Nothing”) was a mistake, in my opinion. Occupy should have learned from the 1970s feminist movement, which campaigned on targeted issues like equal pay and reproductive rights. The lesson for today is obvious: Don’t just oppose Trump; tell us what you’re for.
Despite such challenges, let’s remember there is power in movement. The New Deal, for instance, was not the gift of benign politicians – it was forced on them by a groundswell of public protests by unemployed workers and war veterans, and street marches by starving children, rebelling in the face of the destitution caused by the Depression.
If today’s activists want to make their mark on history, they should celebrate the carnivalesque and ultimately take Horace’s ideal a stage further: less the singular carpe diem and more the plural carpamus diem – let’s seize the day together.

      <title>Tillerson Vows `Peaceful Pressure Campaign&apos; Against North Korea</title>
      <text>Tillerson Vows &apos;Peaceful Pressure Campaign&apos; Against North Korea By Haley and McMaster offer differing views about sanctions National security adviser says ‘all options are on the table’ 
N. Korea Says Test Aimed at Calming U.S. Belligerence 
The U.S. seeks a peaceful resolution but is prepared to use military force if diplomatic efforts fail to end the nuclear standoff with North Korea, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. 
“If our diplomatic efforts fail, though, our military option will be the only one left,” Tillerson said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”“But be clear: we seek a peaceful solution to this.”

The top U.S. diplomat made a rare appearance on a Sunday talk show as President Donald Trump prepares this week to ask allies at the annual United Nations General Assembly to confront the regime’s threat. Trump, in a Sunday tweet, mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as “Rocket Man.” 
Tillerson said the U.S. strategy is to pursue a “peaceful pressure campaign” based on what he called the four “nos”: not seeking either regime change or collapse in North Korea, an accelerated re-unification of the Korean peninsula, or a reason to send in military forces. 
The UN has passed two rounds of sanctions against North Korea, which has continued nonetheless to advance its nuclear program and test its missile capabilities despite condemnation from the international community. Feeling the Pinch 
UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Pyongyang is “already starting to feel the pinch” from the additional sanctions of more than $1 billion. “We have economically strangled North Korea at this point, and they have said as much,” she said. 
Trump told reporters on Sept. 12, after the latest Security Council sanctions vote, that sanctions were “not a big deal,” and National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said on Sunday that there are doubts about whether economic measures will be enough to deter the regime. As a result, the U.S. must “make sure all options are under development,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.” 
McMaster said Kim must relinquish his nuclear weapons because Trump won’t tolerate the threat. Asked whether he was saying the president will strike if Kim doesn’t end his nuclear program, McMaster said, “he’s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.” 
Haley said Trump’s recent comment about raining “fire and fury” on North Korea wasn’t an empty threat, and that she’s “perfectly happy” having Defense Secretary James Mattis take over with military options if diplomacy fails. Diplomatic Remedies 
“We were being responsible by trying to use every diplomatic possibility that we could possibly do,” Haley said on CNN. “We have pretty much exhausted all the things that we could do at the Security Council at this point.” 
“If the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed,” she said.

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said she doesn’t think North Korea will give up its nuclear program, but that diplomatic remedies are still available. China might support a program with a verifiable freeze of North Korea’s missile program if it means “no regime change and no war,” she said. 
“North Korea is not going to give up its program with nothing on the table,” Feinstein said on CNN. Feinstein also said U.S. missile defense “isn’t perfect” and “I am concerned about the safety of the United States.” 
Tillerson said on CBS that China, the principal supplier of oil to North Korea, can help exert pressure on Pyongyang by cutting off supplies, and that Russia can stop using 30,000 North Korean guest workers who send their wages home, propping up the economy. 
Trump said on Twitter Sunday that he spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Saturday night and “Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!” 
McMaster said the tweet appears to be a reference to North Korean leader because “that is where the rockets and missiles are coming from.” Watch This Next Kim Jong Un: Nuke-Wielding Madman or Astute Dictator?

World Donald Trump let loose on Twitter Sunday with a shoot-from-the-hip volley of posts referring to North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un as “Rocket Man”– and picturing himself taking out Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.

      <title>‘ROCKET MAN’ KIM: Trump taunts as UN ‘exhausts options’</title>
      <text>Donald Trump labels Kim Jong-un ‘Rocket Man’ over growing nuclear threat in antagonistic tweet Staff writers, AFP and Reuters, News Corp Australia Network September 18, 2017 3:46pm 
DONALD Trump has taunted Kim Jong-un in a tweet about the rogue North Korean leader’s nuclear ambitions. 
The US president spoke Saturday night with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, pledging joint “steps to strengthen deterrence and defence capabilities and to maximise economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea,” according to the White House. 
President Trump’s own account of the conversation, which kicked off an unbridled salvo of Sunday morning tweets, struck a less diplomatic tone. I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017 
“I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!” the president wrote to his 38 million followers. 
He then launched into half a dozen retweets of internet memes celebrating his Make America Great Again campaign theme — topping it off with a GIF montage of himself taking a swing at a golf ball and knocking out his erstwhile Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. 
The Republican leader is set to address the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time on Tuesday, focusing on North Korea and Iran. ‘US HAS EXHAUSTED OPTIONS’ 
The US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has said the UN Security Council has run out of options on containing North Korea’s nuclear program and the US may have to turn the matter over to the Pentagon. 
“We have pretty much exhausted all the things that we can do at the Security Council at this point,” Ms Haley told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, adding that she was perfectly happy to hand the matter to Defence Secretary James Mattis. 
“We’re trying every other possibility that we have but there’s a whole lot of military options on the table.” UN Ambassador Nikki Haley on Trump’s use of Twitter: “The President can communicate in any form that he wishes” https://t.co/dpErSb5IQN — CNN (@CNN) September 17, 2017 
Ms Haley also defended President Trump’s use of Twitter after he was scolded by the British prime minister over his London attack tweet. 
President Trump was accused of betraying intelligence details by saying those responsible for an explosion on an underground train “are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard,” before adding “must be proactive!” 
“You have to understand the president can communicate in any form that he wishes. And if he uses Twitter, I think what you saw was a reaction to the fact that this was terrible and we cannot let terrorist attacks become part of our normal day,” she said. 
“And when you see a number of these, it makes the president more and more assured that he has to do everything he can to keep Americans safe.” UN calls emergency meeting over North Korea 2:49

      <title>Where are all the monuments to the progressive Americans?</title>
      <text>SOURCE Moyers and Company TAGS human rights progressives The current controversy over whether to dismantle statues of some prominent Confederate figures is a battle over whom we admire and consider as heroes. It is also a battle over who has power to shape how we view our history.
“Many of those people were there to protest the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee,” President Donald Trump said last month after the struggle in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia. “So this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?”
In May, the New Orleans City Council declared monuments of Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate Gen. PGT Beauregard public nuisances and had them removed. In August, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh ordered Confederate monuments removed from the city’s public spaces. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, directed the dismantling of a statue in front of the State House of Roger Taney – a Supreme Court justice who was chief author of the 1857 Dred Scott decision that ruled that African-Americans could not be American citizens. Earlier this month, in response to student protests, Yale University renamed Calhoun College – a residential complex named for John C. Calhoun, a senator from South Carolina, vice president and influential advocate for slavery – Hopper College, after Rear Adm. Grace Murray Hopper, a computer pioneer and naval officer. To buttress the symbolism, Yale removed a portrait of Calhoun from a dining hall.
The New York Times recently published a list of the Confederate monuments that are now subject of controversy in cities across the country.
Not surprisingly, most monuments celebrate political, business and military figures. You can criss-cross the country and find statues, schools, government and university buildings, museums, parks, and streets celebrating presidents, senators, governors, jurists, inventor-entrepeneurs, founders of major corporations, generals and fallen soldiers. But our veneration of them often comes at the expense of recognizing other citizens who had a major role in shaping our nation’s history.
Shouldn’t we also honor the organizers, activists, artists, writers, athletes, judges, and occasional elected officials who fought to make the United States a more humane and inclusive country? What about the pioneers who built movements and gave voice to the struggles for women’s suffrage, protecting the environment and consumers, putting an end to lynching, giving workers the right to form unions, and pushing for a progressive income tax, a federal minimum wage, old-age insurance, the 8-hour workday and government-subsidized health care and housing?
Statue of Harriet Tubman in Harlem New York. (Photo by denisbin / flickr CC 2.0 ) When they first advanced their ideas, they were considered impractical idealists, utopian dreamers or dangerous radicals. Now we take these ideas for granted. We all stand on their shoulders.
To create a partial catalogue of monuments celebrating progressive figures, I’ve drawn on the people profiled in my book, The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame . I’ve identified statues located in public places (but not busts of heads or paintings, parks or public buildings), celebrating these progressive figures.
The list focuses on people whose influence was primarily during the 20th century – so Tom Paine, Daniel Shays, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, William Monroe Trotter, William Lloyd Garrison, Mother Jones, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Henry Demarest Lloyd, John Muir, Ida Wells, Terrence Powderly, Thorsten Veblen and Jacob Riis, among other radicals and reformers, are not included.

It was dedicated on July 14, 2017 and sits opposite the statue of William Jennings Bryan, who beat Darrow in that controversial case.

There’s no sculpture of consumer and labor activist Frances Perkins, but the U.S. Department of Labor building and the Frances Perkins Academy in New York City are named for the first female Cabinet secretary and a crusading New Deal reformer.

      <title>CNN’s Baldwin Shocked When Sports Talker Clay Travis Says He Completely Believes In First Amendment And Boobs</title>
      <text>September 16th, 2017 | Add a Comment 
FOX Sports radio talk show host Clay Travis appeared on CNN Friday afternoon to discuss the controversy over ESPN Jemele Hill calling President Trump a “white supremacist” and the White House calling the remark a fireable offense. 
Travis said while the only two things he completely believes in are the First Amendment and boobs the ESPN host should be fired because the network also canned outspoken conservative and pitching legend Curt Schilling. 
CNN host Brooke Baldwin was absolutely disgusted and so incredulous that she ended the segment earlier than scheduled. Travis has since tweeted, “CNN is so offended that they already called me and asked if I could come back on Monday.” 
CNN is so offended that they already called me and asked if I could come back on Monday. Too perfect.— Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 15, 2017 
Transcript, via CNN: 
BALDWIN: Keith Reed, former ESPN senior writer, who knows and has worked with Jemele Hill, with us. Nice to see you, and Clay Travis with FOX Sports Radio and founder of OutkicktheCoverage.com. 
Gentlemen, good to see both of you. 
And, Clay, to you first. 
Of all the different columnists or even magazines in the wake of Charlottesville specifically, that have called out the president as racist, why do you think he really took this particular target on ESPN and Jemele? 
CLAY TRAVIS, FOX SPORTS RADIO: Well, I think because ESPN is not in the business of commenting randomly on political-related issues. 
If you look at their history, they established about 18 months ago that they don’t believe their people should be in involved in non- sports-related political controversy. 
They suspended and then fired Curt Schilling for saying that he disagreed with the North Carolina transgender bathroom bill. And that had absolutely nothing to do with sports. And they said, look, you can’t have this opinion, it is too conservative. We are not going to allow it. 
I think that’s a bad move. I’m a First Amendment absolutist. I believe in only two things completely, the First Amendment and boobs. 
And so once they made the decision that they were not going to allow a conservative, non-sports-related commentary… 
(CROSSTALK) 
BALDWIN: Wait. Did you just say you believe in the First Amendment – and — hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
I just want to make sure I heard you correctly, as a woman anchoring this show. Did you say — what did you just say? 
TRAVIS: Yes. BALDWIN: You believe in the First Amendment and B-O-O-B-S? 
TRAVIS: Boobs, two things that have only never let me down in this entire country’s history, the First Amendment and boobs. So, those are the only two things I believe in absolutely in the country. 
And so I don’t think Jemele Hill should be fired. But I do think, straight up, that once you make the decision that you were going to let Curt Schilling go, that you have to also make the decision that you’re going to let Jemele Hill go. 
I think that’s a bad decision. I think ESPN has made bad decisions that have led to 13 million subscribers bailing on the network. They have made bad decisions that have led to ratings collapsing. 
Jemele Hill’s television show is collapsing. Ratings were down 20 percent last week over last year. I think that is why she’s angry. I think that’s why she went after Donald Trump. She’s begging for ESPN to fire her, so she can work somewhere else. 
BALDWIN: OK. OK. 
Keith, what are you thinking? 
KEITH REED, FORMER ESPN SENIOR EDITOR: Listen, I’m astonished at almost everything I just heard. 
One of the things that — and Jemele is a personal friend, not just a colleague, but a personal friend. 
One of the things that Jemele has had to deal with her entire career, and many women who I’m friends with in this business and have been friends with in this business for a long time, is sexism, blatant sexism, comments about her appearance, comments about her racially, comments about her inability or perceived inability to be able to comment on sports because of her gender. 
So, for somebody to come on CNN and to say something like the only thing I believe in, and the discussion about… 
(CROSSTALK) 
BALDWIN: I’m just — I’m still there, too. 
And I just want to make sure I’m you hearing correctly. 
B-O-O-Z-E or B-O-O-B-S? 
Because, as a woman, I’m — I’m… 
TRAVIS: I said boobs. I believe completely in the First Amendment and in boobs. Those are the only two things I believe 100 percent in, in this country. 
And, by the way, Jemele has — absolutely nothing to do her background at all. 
(CROSSTALK) 
BALDWIN: Why are you sitting here live on CNN speaking… 
(CROSSTALK) 
TRAVIS: Immediately — did you notice that? He went straight to that. 
REED: Yes. You’re absolutely right. I did go straight to that. 
(CROSSTALK) 
BALDWIN: Why would you even say that live on national television? And with a female host, why would you even go there? 
TRAVIS: I say it live on the radio all the time, because it’s true, and that’s what I do, because I like boobs and the First Amendment, which is exactly what I said. 
REED: Listen, Brooke, I think that speaks for itself. I love the First Amendment as well. I also love women. 
(CROSSTALK) 
TRAVIS: You don’t love boobs, too? 
REED: As one who truly — I’m not going to talk about that on television, because it’s irrelevant to the topic. It shouldn’t be brought up here. 
TRAVIS: Why not? 
REED: I’m a supporter of women in their careers. 
I’m a supporter and a staunch supporter of women like Brooke, who I have shared the airwaves with before, and like Jemele, who is a personal friend of mine for a long time. 
(CROSSTALK) 
BALDWIN: I’m done. I’m sorry. I’m done. 
REED: And to have her anatomy brought up, to have anyone’s anatomy brought up in this conversation, completely… 
(CROSSTALK) 
BALDWIN: I’m done. This is done. This conversation over, yanking mikes. Bye. See you. 
That was entirely inappropriate. 
And it just took me — forgive me that it took me a second. It like live television happens, and you think you hear something, but you are not entirely sure. And then you realize it happened. 
So, I apologize for him in that. 
Let’s move on.

      <title>As World Moves Forward with Paris Accord, U.S. Observes From Sidelines</title>
      <text>  As World Moves Forward with Paris Accord, U.S. Observes From Sidelines Published on Some officials left a climate summit in Montreal this weekend with the impression that Trump could re-enter the Paris agreement—but critics have doubts by 0 Comments Delegates from 30 countries met in Montreal this weekend to discuss implementation of the Paris climate accord without the U.S., following President Donald Trump&apos;s June announcement that he&apos;ll withdraw the country from the agreement. (Photo: @MinisterSilk/Twitter) Amid reports that the U.S. is reviewing the terms of the Paris climate agreement and examining a potential re-entry, climate advocates expressed doubts this weekend about changes in President Donald Trump&apos;s climate policy and about the White House&apos;s insistence that it will renegotiate the hard-won climate accord in any meaningful way. 1:25 AM - Sep 17, 2017 Some news outlets reported Saturday that a summit in Montreal, attended by representatives from 30 countries that signed the accord—with a U.S. delegation observing from the sidelines—left officials with the impression that Trump could reconsider his decision to withdraw from the agreement. MIguel Arias Canete, the European Union&apos;s commissioner for climate action, said that t he U.S. &quot; stated that they will not renegotiate the Paris accord, but they will try to review the terms on which they could be engaged under this agreement.&quot; Ben Schreiber, senior political strategist for Friends of the Earth, stressed that any reports of real change in Trump&apos;s climate agenda are false alarms. &quot;This latest fire drill on the Paris agreement proves only one thing: Donald Trump can’t be trusted,&quot; said Schreiber in a statement. “ Even if Trump does decide to stay in the Paris Agreement, it will not be a victory for the planet because Trump&apos;s actions have made it clear that he has no intention of doing our fair share on climate change.&quot; The White House said on Saturday that its policy has always been that it would leave the climate accord unless its terms can be renegotiated to Trump&apos;s satisfaction. But after a years-long process of hammering out a deal to which 175 parties countries have signed on, other world leaders have rejected this possibility. &quot;The Paris agreement should not be renegotiated,&quot; said Xie Zhenhua, the climate representative for China at the meeting in Montreal, which was called so countries could discuss how to move forward without the U.S. Though China is one of the world’s biggest carbon polluters, it has emerged as a leader in renewable energy in recent years and has been steadfast in its commitment to the Paris accord. Since taking office, even before the withdrawal, Trump has given climate advocates and the Paris accord signatories little reason to hope that his re-negotiation of the agreement would satisfy its goal of keeping the global temperature rise below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. He has rolled back numerous Obama-era regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, which would have replaced coal-fired power plants with wind and solar farms. &quot;Meaningful action by the U.S. would mean rapidly reducing emissions and providing significant climate finance,&quot; said Schreiber. &quot;Trump has taken us in the opposite direction...Donald Trump continues to hold the entire world hostage on climate change.&quot; On social media, Trump critics cast the White House&apos;s hope of changing the hard-won agreement to suit Trump&apos;s terms as out-of-touch and arrogant.</text>

      <title>How could tax reforms impact charities and nonprofits?</title>
      <text>SOURCE NationofChange TAGS charities Donald Trump economy nonprofits politics tax reform Perhaps the most controversial president in U.S. history, President Trump is gearing up to introduce tax reform across the country. In the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey, Trump seems to have taken these natural disasters as opportunities to discuss tax reform again. While some organizations, including our nation’s top automakers, are praising Trump’s new plan, those who operate in the nonprofit or charitable sectors might see fewer donations as a result. Some estimates predict that we’ll lose more than $17 billion in charitable giving under the proposed tax reform.
But the new plan isn’t as cut-and-dry as it seems. With a higher standard deduction for most taxpayers, the average U.S. citizen might see some benefit from President Trump’s new tax plan. Under the proposal, standard deductions will increase from $6,350 to $12,700 for individuals and from $12,700 to $25,500 for those who file jointly. Unfortunately, some experts believe this will lead to less charitable giving across the board.
Community Services Many neighborhoods rely on the services offered throughout their community. Since most of these organizations use public and private donations to operate, some might be forced to close their doors in the wake of President Trump’s new tax plan.
Leaders with GreaterGood.org , a nonprofit that specializes in global markets and commerce, were initially worried about widespread market destabilization as a result of the Trump presidency. Liz Baker, executive director with GreaterGood.org, made it clear that increasing importation costs will likely result in the de-funding of some of their current programming .
Other officials are worried about job loss throughout the community, which could devastate some of the smaller neighborhoods across our country. While some attribute a declining job market to increased automation in the workplace, some forecasts predict that 5 million importing and exporting jobs could be affected during an international market destabilization.

Hospitals and healthcare facilities in the nonprofit sector will also take a hit from Trump’s proposed tax plan. Although the current Internal Revenue Code, or IRC, hasn’t seen any major updates since the mid-80s, this could all change in the coming months or years.
Apart from the general decline in charitable donations from individual taxpayers, the increased standard deduction that is a part of President Trump’s strategy could put a damper on contributions in other ways. Eliminating the federal estate tax could reduce charitable requests across the board while reducing the overall number of tax brackets might introduce any number of new roadblocks or challenges in the future.
The new tax proposals aren’t even the only threats faced by the nonprofit healthcare sector. More than $32 million in funding was withheld from the United Nations’ Population Fund, which assists with family planning and maternal health. Trump has also remained silent about USAID, a program that offers similar services on an international level. USAID has relied on federal funding to operate efficiently and securely around the globe.
Renewable Energy Nonprofits in the renewable energy sector are also targets of the Trump administration. The president’s earliest moves are threatening to cut federal subsidies for renewable energy sources like solar and wind. Nonprofit organizations have relied on these subsidies for the past decade or more. A total of 62 programs in the EPA will likely be cut to accommodate Trump’s budget, including the State Energy Program, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and the Clean Power Plan. Other programs on the chopping block include the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program, the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program, Weatherization Assistance Program and more.
The good news is that some experts in the renewable energy sector believe solar energy is here to stay. With or without the help of federal subsidies, these officials are confident that solar and other forms of renewable energy will continue to replace fossil fuels like coal and oil. They credit additional tax credits and incentives that are increasingly seen on the state level.
How You Can Help Although a higher standard deduction makes it easy to forego your charitable donations, many of these nonprofit organizations wouldn’t exist today if it weren’t for the financial contributions of individuals like you. Couple this with the fact that some nonprofits are facing other challenges in the way of withheld funding, increased governmental regulations and downright program cancellation, and it’s easy to see how President Trump’s proposed tax reforms could have a significant effect on our nation’s charities and nonprofits.

      <title>How Trump’s immigration crackdown threatens ‘Made in America’ dairy-industry miracle</title>
      <text>SOURCE The Center for Public Integrity TAGS dairy DonaldTrump farms immigrants immigration politics Over 30 years, the jade-green Snake River, generous bank loans and old-fashioned muscle have transformed southern Idaho’s Magic Valley from desert to dairy powerhouse.
In excess of 400,000 cows reside in the valley, more than twice the number of humans. Workers in rubber boots pull long shifts feeding livestock, clearing mountains of manure and extracting millions of pounds of milk all day, every day, all year, on ranches tucked into the rock and sagebrush-studded landscape.
Sleek silver tankers filled with milk barrel down Interstate 84 toward dairy processing plants, among them one owned by Chobani, which opened the world’s biggest yogurt factory five years ago just down the road in Twin Falls.
Since 2000, milk production has doubled in Idaho, providing the state with $10.4 billion in direct sales, according to University of Idaho economists.
Chobani’s gleaming $750 million, cream-colored plant is just one of the many big businesses linked to Idaho’s voluminous milk production, now around third- or fourth-largest among states.
In short, the Magic Valley’s dairy boom is a contemporary rural American success story – the kind that President Donald Trump railed as a candidate is too often missing across the country. Unemployment here was less than 3 percent this summer, about as good as it gets, and optimism should be high.
Yet on dairy farms, among both owners and workers, a sense of dread hangs in the dry southern Idaho air.
Why?
In a word: Immigrants.
Dairy farmers lean heavily Republican in this deeply red state of only 1.7 million people, where 88 percent of the voting-age population are non-Hispanic whites. But in the age of Donald Trump – who won Idaho handily – even the farmers who supported the new president fear the fate of their businesses is about to run headlong into a harsh political reality.
They’re frightened that Trump’s aggressive deportation policies will soon start to pick off or push away the mostly Hispanic immigrants who do the gritty work here that Americans aren’t interested in doing at dairies. Many of these workers are probably undocumented, farmers acknowledge, yet they’re the sturdy backbone of a surging industry. Here in the Magic Valley, the farmers’ perspective is starkly different from the president’s rhetorical claim that undocumented workers “compete directly against vulnerable American workers.”
And the farmers’ view is pitting them against a vocal contingent of neighbors who’ve responded both to Trump’s rhetoric and far-right media that’s targeted immigrants as a threat. Southern Idaho, in fact, became a flashpoint for xenophobia this past year when outlets like Breitbart and InfoWars seized on false reports about Muslim refugees – accusing them of gang rapes and the spread of fatal diseases like tuberculosis – and turned the remote area into an anti-immigrant cause celebre. But locally, it’s starting to sink in that Trump’s vows to oust undocumented workers could actually kick the legs out from under the “Made in America” model the Magic Valley exemplifies.
Idaho dairy industry representatives estimate that between 85 to 90 percent of on-site dairy workers in the state are foreign-born. The U.S. Department of Labor and other estimates suggest that nearly half to 70 percent of all U.S. farm laborers are undocumented – certainly enough to shut down many of the milk pumps here if workers are ousted as a result of Trump’s policies.
That’s why farmers’ groups have for years pushed Congress, unsuccessfully, to make it possible for them to legally employ immigrants they say are desperately needed. Prospects don’t look any rosier now. In recent months, anti-immigrant rhetoric has only grown more vitriolic, and Trump supporters – including some here – are expecting the president to follow through on campaign promises and deport more people.
Those who understand the dairy business here fear that a political solution won’t materialize before it’s too late, if ever. And that means businesses could struggle due to labor shortages and plummeting production.
“The dairy industry is a big money maker. But without workers, without somebody that’s going to be there 12 hours a day, milking your cows, getting dirty, there’s no business,” said Shannon Pérez, a non-Hispanic Anglo, as people here say, who’s worked on dairy and calf ranches. She’s already watched helplessly as her own family was split by deportation.
Deportation fear The tension burst into the open this summer in Magic Valley – home to 70 percent of Idaho’s dairy herd – when news broke that Jerome’s county commissioners were close to signing a potential $1.37 million-a-year deal to rent county jail beds to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which would use them to house detainees before possible deportation.
The commissioners were intrigued by the prospect of guaranteed federal dollars. ICE officials said in a statement to the Center for Public Integrity that “ensuring there are sufficient beds available” to meet the demand for detention “is crucial to the success of ICE’s overall mission.”
But in Jerome, panic ensued. Fractures emerged. People took sides. And the issue still isn’t resolved.
Jerome, home to 55 dairies and fewer than 23,000 people, erupted into an angry homegrown version of the national debate over immigration.
Opponents of the deal who envisioned workers fleeing and agents closing in on employers and employees mobilized.
Chobani, which employs more than 1,000 Magic Valley residents, warned in a letter to commissioners that without high-capacity dairies, “our business simply could not exist in its current and thriving form.” An ICE contract would “exponentially increase the fear of families being broken apart and communities being ritually interrogated – an outcome that would ripple far and wide,” wrote Michael Gonda, Chobani’s senior vice president of corporate affairs.
Chobani itself is an immigrant story . Its founder, Hamdi Ulukaya, is a Turkish immigrant who’s come under attack for welcoming Muslim immigrants – including refugees who’ve been hired to work at Chobani’s plant in Twin Falls.
Supporters of the ICE proposal weighed in too, remarking that if immigrants were legal, they had nothing to fear. “I am tired of the illegals running things,” one supporter wrote on a Facebook page set up to push for the deal. “If you want to come here, then do it the right way.”
Local dairy farmers appealed to elected officials and the public to understand that the current immigration system does not provide visas for dairy workers to enter the United States “the right way,” or a path for undocumented workers already here to become legal.
“It’s an education struggle,” said Bob Naerebout, a self-described moderate-to-liberal Republican (he declined to say whom he voted for in the presidential contest) who’s director of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association.
Other than through refugee or asylum programs, the only way that foreigners abroad can even qualify to apply for work or residency visas is through sponsorship by an eligible family member, a potential employer with access to visas or through a lottery for only certain nationalities.
The dairy farmers favor a solution that would permit undocumented workers already here to stay and earn legal work status and an eventual right to try to get a green card that grants legal permanent residency. The farmers’ ideal solution would also create temporary visas allowing dairies to legally fill future shortages as workers age out of the industry. But Republicans in Congress have increasingly hardened a line against earned legalization. Some GOP lawmakers will only support enabling dairy workers already here to adjust to a status as guest workers – with no path to green cards or citizenship.
“Agriculture is the first rung of the American Dream,” said Naerebout. “You also have to look at it from a moral position. These people have helped our industry grow to where it is. They should be the highest priority for us.”
In southern Idaho, farmers insist, immigrants who labor year-round at dairies are creating jobs for Americans, because dairies generate positions in factories, trucking and shipping, banking, technology, construction, feed and vitamin outfits, retail and services. The 8,100 jobs on Idaho dairies statewide generate 3,700 jobs in dairy processing and 27,600 jobs in other businesses, according to research done by University of Idaho agricultural economists at the request of dairymen. In the Magic Valley, researchers estimated, half the jobs are directly or indirectly created by agribusiness.
“The dairy industry is the backbone of your tax base in Jerome County and we cannot be successful without a vibrant Hispanic community,” Naerebout wrote to Jerome’s commissioners in July, urging them to vote against renting beds to ICE.
“Your decision has the potential to take a prosperous Jerome,” he warned, “which has low unemployment and transform it into a struggling rural community with high unemployment like so many other rural communities in America.”
‘Not enough statesmen’ Weaving his truck through a maze of pens, corrals, barns and warehouses, a Jerome County farmer who employs more than 200 people offered his thoughts about immigration policy.
The number one issue facing U.S. dairies today is access to labor that’s documented, said the farmer, who didn’t want his name disclosed because he’s nervous about ICE and a hostile public.
“And it’s all the way from Maine to California to Idaho,” he said. “Put yourself in our shoes. The perfect storm is brewing. They’re building a wall. Tougher immigration policies. A low unemployment rate.”
As he drove, the farmer asked Naerebout, who was riding in the passenger seat, “Bob, why can’t we get an immigration bill?”
“Because we’ve got too many politicians and we don’t have enough statesmen,” replied Naerebout.
“If it were Tip O’Neill or Bob Dole,” the farmer said, referring to Democratic and Republican congressional leaders in the 1980s known for hammering out compromises, “this would have been done by now because they’d cross the aisle.”
As news spread about the possible ICE contract in July, the farmer said he noticed that a husband and wife who worked on his farm caring for thousands of cows had resigned. The couple moved because of the proposal, a supervisor told the farmer, leaving the impression that the couple had a reason for not wanting to stick around.
Fear over the ICE contract, workers here say, has sparked recruiters from dairies in states as far away as Minnesota to poach labor from the Magic Valley. Some local workers “have basically said this is not a safe place for us to be anymore,” Naerebout said.
Moving is exactly what an undocumented woman who arrived in the United States at 18 plans to do if the ICE contract is signed. Now 32, she spoke in between whistling and pushing 1,000-plus pound cows into a barn for milking at a dairy she didn’t want identified.
“I would change states. I wouldn’t want to take the risk,” said the mother of four, who asked that her name not be disclosed. “Agents would be in Jerome, on the streets, going into restaurants. How would they not be asking people about their papers? Until now, people really haven’t had to be afraid much.”
Nationwide, as undocumented immigrants tell it, the status quo has been that if you wanted work, it was there. For decades, immigrant workers linked by networks of friends and relatives have shown up at U.S. farms with genuine-looking documents, which businesses aren’t legally required to authenticate. Since Congress approved the last big immigration reform in 1986, employers have only been required to record information on employees’ documents and keep it on file.
It’s a “don’t ask, don’t tell” arrangement that’s kept farms going for years.
To keep workers here, Naerebout said dairies are starting to pay $14 an hour on average in the area, almost double the state’s minimum wage of $7.25. Workers in town say the pay can vary, as low as $10 an hour for shifts that can last 12 hours. Even if out-of-towners, U.S. citizens nor not, were interested, reasonable pay might not attract them to remote Jerome – two hours from Boise and three from Salt Lake City.
Dairies have also turned to newly arrived refugees for labor.
Twin Falls, 16 miles south of Jerome, has absorbed small waves of refugees for nearly 40 years, starting with Southeast Asians, and more recently Africans and people from the Middle East. The College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls coordinates this resettlement and has helped find jobs for refugees in some dairies, where they earn between $100 and $120 a day, said Zeze Rwasama, a Congolese refugee who’s now a U.S. citizen and director of the college’s Refugee Center .
But politics is intruding. Rep. Raul Labrador, one of Idaho’s two Republican congressmen, is sponsoring a bill that would allow governors or city officials to prohibit the settlement of refugees in their jurisdictions. The bill passed the House Judiciary Committee in June.
Todd Winer, Labrador’s communications director, said that “the purpose of America’s refugee program is humanitarian, not to expand the labor pool.”
Naerebout called the refugee prohibition proposal an idea to appeal both to the GOP’s far-right base and concerns about the admission of Syrian Muslims. The local farmer has hired and trained Congolese and Asian refugees to milk cows alongside the more numerous Hispanic workers. He scowled at the proposal. “We’re at the mercy of politicians,” he said.
A variety of polls show that most Americans agree with the farmers that undocumented workers shouldn’t be prevented from a way to stay legally in the United States, even in states like Idaho that supported Trump.
Failed bids for legalization As he drove, the farmer pointed to Latino men in manure-covered boots wrestling a calf; one held a hypodermic needle. Every calf bears a radio frequency tag that transmits data to workers that tell them when shots are required as well as other needed care. Immigrant women in a warehouse were sanitizing hundreds of bottles they would later fill with formula and stack on a wagon. The bottles feed newborn calves.
Inside a milking parlor outfitted with computers, workers moved with factory-like precision lining up cows that are each milked three times a day.
A woman who works 12 hours a day frenetically moved from animal to animal, attaching suction devices to udders. She said in Spanish, wrinkling her nose, that the cows defecate “all the time.” It’s hard to escape manure and mess, although this ranch looked exceptionally clean, with showers and lockers and a spotless lunchroom for workers.
Outside, on three poles rising from a landscaped island of bright green grass, flew the American, Idaho and Mexican flags. The farmer said it shows respect for his workers. Jerome County is now about 34 percent Hispanic.
Expecting American-born workers to fill all dairy jobs is unrealistic, farmers say, because Americans have their pick of other jobs that aren’t as grimy and can pay more. Hildegardo Torres, in his 50s and an immigrant who received amnesty in 1986, is a supervisor who watches overmilking and storage equipment for an unidentified farm. He’s often on call night or day to ensure the system that funnels milk to tanks keeps it chilled at the specific temperature processors require.
“Sometimes they come, these American guys,” Torres said. “They work, they try, they leave. And the next day they don’t come anymore.”
In their quest to legalize workers, Idaho farmers were enthusiastic about a once-promising proposal called the AgJOBS bill, which former Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, first introduced in 2003. The bill was a rare compromise crafted by labor activists and employers that once had 62 co-sponsors . But it faltered multiple times under withering attacks by activists favoring less immigration.
Craig’s bill would have opened an earned legalization program for undocumented crop and dairy workers who stayed on farms for a set number of years. It would also have let dairy employers in on temporary work visas, issued by the H-2A visa program, and allowed their workers to eventually apply for available immigrant visas.
The H-2A non-immigrant farmworker program is currently only available for employers to sponsor foreign workers who perform seasonal crop work for around 10 months or less, with only limited extensions of time. Dairies are prohibited from using the program to sponsor workers who milk and remove manure because those jobs are year-round.
The United States also sets aside about 5,000 low-skilled immigrant visas a year that allows U.S. employers to sponsor workers to legally immigrate. But this program isn’t a viable option for dairy farmers given how few visas are available and the years-long backlog.
The realities and nuances of visas are lost on a public that has listened to years of far-right talk radio and television, which has vilified the undocumented, Naerebout said.
In the Magic Valley, Bill Colley, a right-wing talk radio host, has used his perch at Fox affiliate KLIX to cast doubt on the resettlement of Muslim refugees locally, and to scoff at the concerns of the area’s dairy farmers. KLIX broadcasts from Twin Falls, the valley’s biggest city, with 48,000 people. Colley also writes a column for the Twin Falls Times-News newspaper.
During a broadcast, after Trump was elected, Colley said Hispanic workers who cross the border without permits “obviously don’t have any of what you’d call morals to begin with,” and end up “dropping anchor babies.”
“And we want these people here?” he snarled.
Colley did not respond to requests for comment.
“Talk radio’s purpose,” Naerebout said, is to deliver high ratings, not facts. “When it boils the blood of listeners they just hype it all the more.”
In April, Chobani sued Internet shock jock Alex Jones , accusing him of “defamatory” remarks in a video and tweets that linked the company’s hiring of Muslim refugees to crime and disease in Idaho. Jones responded by retracting and acknowledging his missives as “wrong.”
Small city, divided lives In downtown Jerome, a city where half of the county’s 23,000 residents live, the hip café Renew serves cappuccinos, and streets are lined with Mexican restaurants such as La Campesina and auditoriums where locals celebrate weddings, rodeo parties and Hispanic girls’ 15th birthdays, called quinceañeras .
Founded in 1919, Jerome retains the flavor of a Western pioneer town surrounded by open space, where settlers put down roots near the Snake River. Several prominent local buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Depression-era Jerome County Courthouse built with federal New Deal funds. That’s where hundreds of Hispanic residents and dairy farmers jammed into a July 10 hearing to protest the ICE jail beds proposal.
The unusual show of protest by immigrant families and employers carrying “No ICE” signs left Charles Howell, the chairman of the Jerome County Commission, “flabbergasted.”
Howell, an electrician, said it didn’t occur to him that renting jail beds to ICE would frighten people. Based on what the local sheriff and ICE representatives told commissioners, he envisioned ICE agents dropping off people at the jail they’d picked up elsewhere and not conducting any more enforcement in Jerome than usual.
“This is the hardest thing I’ve had to deal with as a commissioner,” Howell said. “Jerome’s economic driver is the dairies and agriculture.”
He suggested “the feds get off their rears” to figure out how to create a dairy labor force that’s not undocumented.
The commissioners have yet to issue a decision.
At Jerome’s El Sombrero restaurant on Main Street, an undocumented worker who’s been in the United States for 20 years – half her life – sat with other women who’ve worked in dairies or are related to dairy workers.
The woman, too nervous to disclose her name, said she’s arranging her affairs in case she’s deported. She’s designated a niece to take over the home she owns here. Her two daughters are older teens living elsewhere.
The woman has done all sorts of jobs at dairies, from feeding calves to milking and driving trucks carting feed. “We get up, we milk, we eat, we sleep,” she said. “Now we’re waiting to see if it’s our turn to get deported.”
She said Americans in town mostly seem “indifferent” to immigrant workers.
Three recent Magic Valley incidents underscore how vulnerable to abuse immigrant workers can become – and why labor activists also want to legalize workers. In 2016, two men drowned in manure when trucks they were driving fell into farms’ unmarked waste ponds and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued $5,000 fines for unsafe conditions.
This year, six Mexican veterinarians who had been sponsored on special professional work visas in 2014 filed a human-trafficking lawsuit alleging that Jerome employers evaded U.S. immigration laws by offering them “false promises of professional work as animal scientists” and temporary work visas issued under provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The dairy companies deny the allegations.
Rare penalties for employers Even as the dairy industry has expanded in Jerome, it’s been rare up to now for federal agents to interrupt operations due to immigration violations.
In 2012, immigration agents arrested only 240 managers for criminal immigration-related violations in a four-state area that includes Idaho, Montana, Utah and Nevada. That was the highest annual total in recent years in an area with nearly half a million businesses.
For now, individual immigrants are the prime targets.
President Obama directed ICE to focus on undocumented people with serious criminal records, and less on those with longtime ties to communities and close relatives who were U.S. citizens. Trump ended that policy, and now cases of parents and spouses of U.S. citizens being taken into custody and deported are appearing with greater frequency nationwide.
Jerome resident Pérez, 38, who keeps the books for a calf ranch, said most people in town assume all foreigners have to do is patiently fill out paperwork to obtain a green card – especially if they’re married to a U.S. citizen. After she married an undocumented Mexican dairy worker in 2003, she found out that was far from true. The couple applied for Pérez’s spouse to get a green card, through her sponsorship, but it was denied because he was undocumented and had been deported before. The Pérez family moved to Mexico for two years to see if applying from abroad would help smooth a request for waivers. But ultimately, Pérez’s husband was told he would be barred for life because he had been deported multiple times prior to their marriage. Pérez returned to Jerome with the couple’s four children. And the husband ventured north illegally again.
“He came back to support his family,” she said. He was deported again in 2006 after Pérez was pulled over in a traffic stop while she was driving, and her husband was quizzed about his status. He returned in 2009, but was deported again last year.
“So my kids are without their dad,” she said. The couple ended up divorcing, but she doesn’t want the children to be fatherless. “The government is making it that way,” she said.
Tension over immigration has also split Pérez from her relatives.
One close relative, she said, watches television news focusing disproportionately on crimes committed by undocumented people. Trump won 69 percent of votes in Jerome County, and Pérez believes Trump’s negative focus on the undocumented contributed. Yet it’s immigrants, she said, who occupy the bottom-rung jobs that must be done.
“The documented side of the country doesn’t want those dairy jobs,” said Pérez. “Would you want to come home smelling like rotten milk? Like cow manure?”
Not far from a small office in downtown Jerome that Pérez rents, a group of non-Hispanic friends were gathered at Jerome’s Steelhorse Motorcycle Leathers and Accessories shop on South Lincoln Avenue. They applauded Trump’s stepped up deportations. But none complained that immigrant dairy workers were taking jobs from Americans.
“If they want to be here, get them legal,” said a shop worker, Marty Fuqua. “The problem is they’re coming across illegally, doing their drugs, doing their crimes, you know, rape, rob and murder. And then they expect a free ride. Well, you’re going to get a free ride. Straight to our jail and back to your country.”
Another man insisted dairy farmers could get temporary work visas for workers and was surprised to learn that they couldn’t. The tone of conversation began to soften.
Ryan Bennett, the youngest of the group at 23, works in the warehouse of the Jerome Cheese Co., a major processor that operates day and night. He said he was upset that one of his best friends was deported. Bennett grew up in Jerome and went to school with many Hispanic kids.
“Get all the ones that they know about, the undocumented immigrants, and if they don’t have any felony charges, violent crimes on their record, [then] do whatever the state and federal agencies can do to legalize them,” Bennett said. “And get them back to work.”
“We need them,” Bennett said.

      <title>Tucker Carlson: If Hillary Clinton Is Such A Strong Woman, Why Is She Playing The Victim?</title>
      <text>September 15th, 2017 | Add a Comment 
On Wednesday’s night show, Tucker Carlson said the “sexism trope” from Hillary Clinton is annoying because it’s so “patronizing.” Carlson asked if it is sexist that the majority of married women voted for Donald Trump. 
Former Clinton adviser Richard Goodstein argued why the former presidential candidate makes valid points in her memoir about her loss in the election. 
CARLSON: Richard Goodstein advised the Clinton campaign in both 2008 and 2016, he joins us on the set tonight. Richard, I’ve never — this is the key question I have never understood, I mean it with all sincerity. If Hillary Clinton was such a strong woman, she’s always telling me she is, why is she playing the victim? 
RICHARD GOODSTEIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, she’s playing the victim because she was victimized. Indulge me with the first point that Mark just made about O.J. The single most telling moment of this whole Russian investigation was James Comey testifying that in the nine times that he talked with Donald Trump, Trump never once asked, what did the Russians do? Which was like O.J. never asking the police what happened to Nicole. He knew. 
CARLSON: Okay. That’s evidence right there. Not colluding. Well — 
(CROSSTALK) 
Is that what you’re saying? 
GOODSTEIN: His son has already admitted to collusion. Right? 
CARLSON: Yes. 
GOODSTEIN: You know, it’s like going to rob the bank, unfortunately, he claims, the vault was empty. But he definitely tried to rob the bank. 
CARLSON: Right. Okay. Let me just ask you a bigger question though. So, she blames sexism, as she always does and always has. I’m not a Hillary hater by the way at all. And she’s got good qualities, but the sexism trope is annoying because it’s so stupid and it’s also so patronizing. The majority of married women in America voted for Donald Trump, are they sexist? 
GOODSTEIN: Ask Carly Fiorina. Have you asked her whether she was objected to sexism? Have you asked other leaders in the industry? 
CARLSON: I’m not saying sexism doesn’t exist. I’m saying Hillary Clinton is saying that sexism among American voters, their distaste for powerful woman, strong woman like herself led to her defeat. And my question is, if sexism played such a role, why did the majority of married women, not men, women, vote for Hillary? It does not make sense. Unless they are sexist too. In which case it’s a conspiracy more vast than I even imagine. 
GOODSTEIN: Right. So, she actually did better among women than Barack Obama had. Look, the fact of the matter is — 
CARLSON: She lost married woman! 
GOODSTEIN: What she would tell you is that all these messages that the Russians and the Macedonians, your favorite, paid for that went into people who were undecided in this swing counties in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, actually influenced opinion. Just like your billions of advertisers on FOX News want to change people’s minds. 
CARLSON: I mean, it’s a little bit patriotism because what she’s saying is, opposition to me is unreasonable. Either you are hoodwinked by a foreign power or you are blinded by your own bigotry. She doesn’t allow for what actually happened, which is a lot of people took a sober look at her and Trump and said, you know what, I got problems with him but I prefer him to her because I just don’t like her. She’s not even open to that possibility.

      <title>In this Korean crisis, Trump’s bullying tactics aren’t working and never will</title>
      <text>SOURCE NationofChange TAGS Donald Trump military North Korea nuclear missiles politics war “All options, including military actions, are on the table.” When asked if he was serious about possibly launching an attack on North Korea, Trump replied, “We’ll see.” Tough words coming from this country’s “work in progress” Commander-in-Chief!
That kind of macho rhetoric does nothing but exacerbate an already very troubling situation. Instead of those reckless threats we need deep thinking and rational decision-making to prevent some ill-advised action by one side or the other from igniting a massive war.
The more that Trump threatens North Korea the more paranoid its leaders become; and the more they intensify efforts to successfully develop a nuclear strike capability.
North Korean leaders want this nuclear program as the means by which they can hold the U.S government and its military at bay; they strongly believe that, if they possess this power, U.S. leaders will think twice before they ever take steps to launch any kind of attack on their nation, attempt to depose its current leader, Kim Jong-un; or some leader in the future.
Many experts in world affairs believe that if it were not for America’s highly aggressive military agenda that has been aimed at North Korea for many decades, that that nation would never have initiated a nuclear development program.
It’s common knowledge that North Korea has thousands of sophisticated artillery pieces located on its border with South Korea, by which it can launch missiles at any given time that would devastate the city of Seoul and kill untold numbers of its citizens. This is why the U.S. military has, at least so far, decided not to launch an attack against the North and its leader, Kim Jong-un.
So we now have a deadly standoff between these two sworn enemies. Negotiations to come to some kind of agreement are not on the agenda at this time. So the impasse continues and North Korea intends to launch more ICBM’s until this weapons system is fully functional.
Here’s another example of how Trump’s dangerous rhetoric fans the flames of war; Business Insider reported that, “The White House on Sunday published a readout of President Donald Trump’s talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that listed ‘nuclear capabilities’ as an option for dealing with North Korean aggression; pure madness!
That kind of misguided threat should scare everyone in America, North Korea and the entire world. More and more psychiatrists and associated mental health experts are issuing warnings about Trump’s mental state; that he shows clear signs of mental instability. What’s going to happen if this president, in some fit of rage, loses control and gives the order to launch an attack, possibly a nuclear one, on North Korea?
This is not just speculative thinking; this could actually happen at any given time, it’s that dangerous.
Trump keeps prodding China to get involved to persuade North Korea to back off its nuclear program but China is very reluctant to do so. He has threatened to cut off trade with China if continues to refuse to use its powerful influence in this matter.
Wow, cutting off trade with the country that manufactures the lion’s share of your consumer goods; that’s brilliant thinking. U.S. imports from China are about $480 billion so if Trump cuts a significant portion of them off he will bring American commerce to a near standstill, virtually crippling the economy.
What would he do next; try to resurrect the U.S. manufacturing sector and restart the process of making the bulk of our own products? Good luck with that!
Trump recently tweeted that the U.S. was also going a step further and thinking about stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea.
Nothing like threatening other major trading partners, including many of our allies; that’s bull in a china shop thinking.
In the past, when America was in the midst of some monumental crisis, much like this one that involves a nuclear threat, what former presidents stand out as examples of leaders who dealt with them in a controlled, resolute manner in order to defuse a dangerous situation?
Two former presidents immediately come to mind. President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced one crisis after another during World War II and he, together with his close advisers, made decisions in a rational, controlled manner. As the war progressed, his leadership convinced Americans that the U.S. would prevail and they would be safe. He was certainly an inspiration to this country’s citizens during those trying times.
Dwight D. Eisenhower, during that same war when he was a U.S. general and the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in Europe, also faced various crises in which he had to act decisively but with necessary caution and careful planning.
In one of his greatest achievements he planned and implemented Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, which proved to be the turning point in that war, leading to the defeat of Nazi Germany. He was an example of what a true leader is, calm in the midst of a crisis, resolute about his mission.
Does Mr. Trump remind us of either of these two giants of history? Does he have any of the characteristics of these strong leaders? FDR and Ike had their faults, to be sure, and some of their decisions were criticized, but they knew how to act when it was necessary. The America of today does not have those kinds of leaders.
How in the world is this crisis ever going to be resolved without a deadly war erupting? There are two scenarios that come to mind when trying to determine what will happen.
The most viable solution to defuse this rapidly escalating situation appears to be the one that many experts on this matter, together with Russia and China, are proposing. What just might convince North Korea to enter into negotiations would be a promise by the U.S. to remove its 28,500 troops out of South Korea, cease its joint military exercises in that country, and remove various weapons systems from the Korean Peninsula. That would assuage a great deal of North Korea’s paranoia relative to U.S. military power.
This is, without a doubt, the best solution. Does the U.S. need that military presence in South Korea and the Korean Peninsula? Absolutely not because it has unlimited air, ground and naval power located within striking distance of Korea in any number of bases in that region.
If Trump and his military advisers totally reject this proposal then they are not only foolish but grossly incompetent. They will be giving Kim Jong-un and his military even more incentive to escalate the development of their nuclear program and build a nuclear arsenal.
If that happens, i.e., the U.S. refuses to remove those troops and weaponry from South Korea, historians will record that the most powerful nation and military in world history could not prevent North Korea from becoming the 10th nuclear power on this planet.

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 9 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images Originally published on September 17, 2017 2:02 pm 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. Connect with us!</text>

      <title>Kid Who Mowed WH Lawn Wrote Obama A Letter But Got Diff Response</title>
      <text>Comment 
He’s only 11 years old, but he wanted to do something special. 
So Frank Giaccio (he goes by FX) wrote to President Donald Trump and asked if he could mow the White House lawn. 
“Even though I’m only 10, I’d like to show the nation what young people like me are ready for. I admire your business background and have started my own business,” he wrote, adding that he has mowed his neighbors’ lawns “for some time.” He also offered to bring “extra fuel” for the lawnmower. 
Knowing an entrepreneur when he sees one, Trump took him up on the offer and invited him to mow the lawn of the Rose Garden. Frank “FX” Giaccio-On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania &amp; myself, THANK YOU for doing a GREAT job this morning! @NatlParkService gives you an A+! pic.twitter.com/135DxuapUI 
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 
The Blaze reports that Trump and others even came out to greet Frank and walk with him while he worked. 
“Wow, great job, Frank,” Trump said. Frank kept working but eventually stopped to shake hands with the president. 
Trump asked Frank what he would like to do when he grows up. He replied that he wants to be a Navy SEAL. 
“Well, he’ll make it, there’s no doubt about it,” Trump said. “That’s a good choice.” 
Addressing onlookers, Trump said, “Future of the country right there.” 
“We’re lucky, that’s the real future of the country,” he added. . @POTUS stopped by to thank Frank for his hard work. H/t @NatlParkService for making Frank&apos;s dream of mowing the @WhiteHouse lawn come true! pic.twitter.com/WYvOFbkGsn

Trump said that one day Frank “will be very famous. He’s going to be a Navy SEAL someday. He’s going to do great things for the country.” After congratulating him on a job well done, Trump invited Frank into the oval office. “Maybe he’ll be President,” he said. Frank is hard at work in the Rose Garden and doing a great job! pic.twitter.com/u4f2DtLvu6

Frank’s a businessman. He said he has “two and one half” clients in his lawn-mowing business,” but is looking ahead. After all, he’s got great publicity. 
Cute story, right? Now here’s the kicker. 
This isn’t the first time Frank offered to mow the White House Lawn. Last year, he sent the same letter to President Obama, but got a very different result. 
“Well, my last one, which went to President Obama, I got a letter back. But I knew it wasn’t handwritten, so I knew that this one was actually better…” 
Well, good for Frank and good for President Trump for stepping up and giving this kid the recognition he deserves. 
It’s shocking , isn’t it that President Obama would ignore a request like this?

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 2 minutes ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday.  </text>

      <title>China’s mood on North Korea is toughening – despite Trump’s bluster | Tania Branigan | Opinion | The Guardian</title>
      <text>E ven a man as self-deluding and indifferent to truth as Donald Trump is unable to claim that his threats have cowed North Korea. Five weeks ago, he warned of “fire and fury”. Since then, Pyongyang has launched three missiles – two over Japan – and tested another nuclear bomb. Trump continues to wave his stick, talking on Friday of “effective and overwhelming” options, despite widespread warnings of the immense risk that they would bring catastrophe, not least for US allies and service people.
Allies fear he is genuinely willing to take military action. Most probably, he believes he will not need to do so: if only he keeps shouting, the North Koreans will fall into line eventually.
But the remarks may also be directed at China, with the aim of scaring it into toughening its stance. Trump’s initial attempts to outsource the problem to Beijing were a predictable failure. He has not made much progress since. Though the UN sanctions agreed last week were hailed as the strongest yet, Trump had a point in calling them a small step. Each crisis brings demands for Beijing to turn up the pressure – followed by sanctions watered down until China agrees to sign on.
Yet there are signs that feeling is shifting in China . When its foreign ministry spokesperson described current problems as “complicated, sensitive and grim”, it could have been been a Facebook relationship status for Beijing and Pyongyang. An always suspicious alliance took a sharp turn for the worse with Kim’s accession; he has never met China’s president, Xi Jinping, who is said to regard him with disdain, if not contempt.
Recent events have sharpened Beijing’s antagonism. Calls for stronger action against its neighbour are growing. This week an influential academic suggested that China may have no choice but to hold talks with the US on contingency planning for war – an idea it has rejected repeatedly – even given the likely backlash from Pyongyang.
Cheng Xiaohe, another Chinese expert on the relationship, says stinging criticism of that proposal indicates the depth of divisions over North Korea . But he adds that the call shows more people are realising how serious the situation has become, and that popular opinion is increasingly unfavourable to the north. Sentiment about the joint “war to resist American aggression and defend Korea (aka the Korean war) is fading; concerns about the destabilisation of the region and even possible contamination from nuclear tests grow.
North Korea’s programme has increased the tensions and risk of conflict. It has led to the deployment of anti-missile defences that China believes could affect its own military capabilities, and to calls for Japan and South Korea to develop their own nuclear deterrents. It encourages greater US engagement in the region. None of these are in China’s interests.
That does not mean Beijing will shut off the crude oil supplies on which its neighbour relies, despite the US secretary of state’s renewed push on Friday. China wants the north to change course, not collapse: it has no desire to lose its buffer and see US troops on its doorstep. Nor does it want to see refugees flooding across its border, or a civil war and unsecured nuclear weapons next door. (It may also be unconvinced – as are some experts – that even a total oil ban could force North Korea to change course.)
Smaller shifts in policy look more plausible, but not any time soon: with a crucial party congress to next month, Chinese decision makers are preoccupied with domestic politics . And they are sceptical about the tendency to rely on sanctions as a cure-all.
Above all, Beijing still sees this as primarily a US problem, requiring a primarily US solution. And it is right. Pyongyang wants a security guarantee from Washington. Donald Trump’s inconsistencies and bellicose rhetoric, so oddly reminiscent of Pyongyang’s, are inflaming the situation. War remains a very unlikely outcome. But he has substantially increased the risk of miscalculations and misunderstandings.
Meanwhile, he has undermined arguably the single most important factor in stabilising the region: a rock-solid conviction that the US will not waver in standing by its allies. As a candidate, Trump suggested he would withdraw US troops unless South Korea paid a greater share of costs. More recently, he argued it should pay for the Thaad missile defence system. Ditching the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement has made many question the broader US commitment to the region. Now he is reportedly threatening to pull out of the Korus trade deal with Seoul. Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, warns that countries in the region “don’t understand what the Trump administration’s strategy is, or whether there is one.”
Fresh thinking in China on how to handle North Korea is welcome. But even Beijing’s best efforts will be of limited use without a principled, calm, comprehensive and coherent US policy – of which there is currently no sign.

      <title>Donald Trump Tweets About &apos;Rocket Man,&apos; Vowing More Pressure On Kim Jong Un : The Two-Way</title>

For just under half an hour Saturday night, President Trump and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, tackled the missile threat looming from Pyongyang. The pair of leaders condemned North Korea&apos;s recent ballistic missile test — and once more vowed to strengthen their joint defenses and ratchet up economic pressure on Kim Jong Un still further. 
Trump asked Moon &quot;how Rocket Man is doing&quot; — as the U.S. president put it in a Sunday morning tweet — and took note of the &quot;long gas lines forming in North Korea,&quot; presumably as a result of the stricter sanctions recently implemented. I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017 
Just days ago, the North sailed a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido for the second time in three weeks. The new launch — Pyongyang&apos;s fifteenth missile test this year and its first since testing its most powerful nuclear weapon yet — immediately drew a raft of international condemnations. 
After their conversation Saturday night, Trump and Moon declared their commitment &quot;to continuing to take steps to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities and to maximize economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea,&quot; according to the White House. &quot;The two leaders noted that they will continue their close consultations next week when they meet on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly.&quot;</text>

      <text>NRL star responds to sex scandal Brisbane’s soaring property market Tattoos could cause cancer Sad reality after Hillary lost Apple unveils iPhone X and 8 Sydney gran’s alleged coke run North Korea’s insane new threat NASA’s insane asteroid mission Live: Rush Hour
Here are the headlines on news.com.au today. North Korea has threatened the United States with the “greatest pain” over crippling new sanctions. NASA is planning to slingshot a spacecraft onto an asteroid, and a Sydney grandmother has been accused of running cocaine to high-flying clients right across the city.

NRL star responds to sex scandal
NRL star Bodene Thompson has broken his silence on a messy sex scandal.
His former partner alleged on Tuesday the 29-year-old Warriors forward broke team rules to have sex before NRL matches and engaged in group sex with teammates.
Sydney Penthouse model and stripper Belinda Medlyn told Daily Telegraph she consented to group sex with the rugby star and his teammates.
She said the pair’s 15-month-old son Hendrix was conceived while one of Thompson’s teammates watched on.
He has now issued a statement to Channel Nine.
“I am most concerned that these allegations, which occurred many years ago, have been raised so publicly ... to the detriment of myself and my child. This story has no benefit except to attempt to smear my reputation.
“Although I do not wish to give any more oxygen to this story, I believe it is important to put the facts on the table.”
He said Ms Medlyn approached him in June 2017 threatening that she would expose this story over a dispute over his child support payments.
“I love my son and I have been striving to have a relationship with him. Ms Medlyn has made this difficult, however I continue to seek avenues to pursue having a proper relationship with my son.
“I continue to meet all of my financial obligations to my son and work hard to ensure his future.”

Brisbane’s soaring property market
House prices in Brisbane are soaring, with some inner-city suburbs increasing by more than 20 per cent in the past 12 months.
Realestate.com.au reports St Lucia, Ascot, Auchenflower and Wilston were the best performing suburbs, with prices rising by more than $150,000.
Property experts say the Queensland’s southeast had emerged as a powerhouse property market generating solid capital growth for homeowners.
The latest Real Estate Institute of Queensland quarterly report shows the Brisbane local government area median house price rose 3.6 per cent over the year to June to a new high of $655,000.
That’s nearly 60 per cent higher than it was a decade ago.

Tattoos could cause cancer
Scientists have uncovered a link between your favourite ink and cancer.
Researchers from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France say the chemicals in tattoo ink travel in the blood stream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, obstructing their ability to fight infections.
It’s not the first time tattoos have been linked to cancer.
Titanium dioxide, a chemical commonly used to create white ink, is known to increase the risk of the disease, as well as causing delayed healing in the wound.
“When someone wants to get a tattoo, they are often very careful in choosing a parlour where they use sterile needles that haven&amp;apos;t been used previously,” said study author Hiram Castillo.
“No one checks the chemical composition of the colours, but our study shows that maybe they should.”

Sad reality after Hillary lost
Hillary Clinton has revealed sad details about how she coped with her crushing loss to Donald Trump in the US election.
Early in her new book What Happened , which was released overnight in the US, Mrs Clinton writes about her heavy disappointment on November 9, 2016.
On a rainy day in New York City, she gave her belated concession speech and spent a long time in the crowd afterwards consoling her devastated supporters.
“I had to fight back a wave of sadness that threatened to swallow me whole.
“At every step, I felt I had let everyone down. Because I had.”
After leaving the speech venue, Mrs Clinton was driven back to her home in Chappaqua, north of the city, where she “kept the rest of the world out” as she, and the rest of the US, came to terms with a Trump presidency.
Soon, her sadness turned to anger, and while she publicly remained quiet, behind closed doors she was unable to contain her rage.

Apple unveils iPhone X and 8
Apple has unveiled its landmark iPhone X model, which its creators have described as “the biggest leap forward since original”.
Chief executive officer Tim Cook took to the stage at Steve Jobs Theater in California overnight to begin a new chapter for the world’s most valuable technology firm.
He unveiled three new iPhone models, including the premium tenth anniversary model.
“Our teams have been hard at work for years on something that is important to all of us: the future of the smartphone,” he said.
“It is only fitting that we are here in this theatre on this place to reveal a product that will set the tone for the next decade.”
The iPhone X will have an edge-to-edge screen that will be unlocked via game-changing face-recognition sensors.
It has glass on the front and back with a stainless steel band around the sides.
The device is water and dust resistant, and will come in space grey and silver.

Sydney gran’s alleged coke run
A grandmother, her daughter and son-in-law have been accused of running cocaine to wealthy clients across Sydney as part of an elaborate syndicate.
The Daily Telegraph reports Suellen Cryer, 64, Hope Martyn, 39, and David Martyn, 45, allegedly spent six months plying their illicit wares last year.
According to documents filed in the Central District Court, they are accused of collecting up to 30 bags of cocaine a night from a couple in Darlinghurst and distributed them to customers across the north shore and eastern beaches.
They allegedly hired a different rental car each week to run drugs from Thursday night until Sunday morning, hiding the cocaine in silicone tubes.

North Korea’s insane new threat
North Korea has blasted “vicious” sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council over its latest and most powerful nuclear test, threatening revenge against Washington, who it blamed for leading the charge.
“Yesterday the Washington regime fabricated the most vicious sanctions resolution,” Pyongyang’s ambassador in Geneva told the UN Conference on Disarmament in the first North Korean reaction to Monday’s unanimous vote.
“My delegation condemns in the strongest terms and categorically rejects the latest illegal ... UN Security Council resolution,” ambassador Han Tae Song told the gathering.
“The forthcoming measures by DPRK (the Democratic Republic of Korea) will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history.”
The move by the Security Council slaps a ban on textile exports and restricts shipments of oil products to punish Pyongyang for its sixth and largest nuclear test.

NASA’s insane asteroid mission
A crack team of astronomers, researchers and amateur star gazers will track the historic flight of a NASA spacecraft as it skims over Australia later this month.
The OSIRIS-REX spacecraft is en route to the carbonaceous asteroid Bennu and the plan is to use Earth’s gravity to get it there.
The spacecraft will come within 17,000 kilometres of Earth as it uses the planet’s gravity to slingshot itself toward its destination.
The manoeuvre is known as Earth Gravity Assist and will allow the spacecraft “to match the speed of the Bennu asteroid,” says Professor Phil Bland from Curtin University in Western Australia, who will be watching the event unfold.
“It turns out with a slight modification to our cameras, and the help of some amateur astronomers in Australia, we should be able to see it, and track it as it flies over.”
Aside from sounding really cool, the project helps answer some fundamental questions about the origin of celestial materials that land on Earth.
“We don’t know where meteorites comes from,” Prof Bland said.
Now they’ll be able to track the journey they take to get to earth.

      <title>Trump Administration’s plan to terminate DACA impacts Mercer students</title>
      <text>Send Email Cancel Mercer students are among those impacted by President Donald Trump administration’s announcement about the plan to terminate the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) order. Former President Barack Obama passed the executive order approving DACA in 2012. DACA gave 800,000 immigrants or “Dreamers” a grace period to work, study and live without the threat of deportation. The requirements to receive DACA include: arriving to the United States before 2007, being under the age of 31 by 2012, living continuously in the country, have no felony charges, have no more than three misdemeanors or a significant misdemeanor and be in school or have a high school degree or a general education development (GED), according to Homeland Security’s website. DACA recipients pay a $495 fee renewal fee every two years. Eduardo Rubio is a sophomore at Mercer University who is triple-majoring in economics, math and computer science. Rubio is a DACA recipient. “[DACA] allows immigrants who came as children, such as me, a shot at normal American life. [It allows us to] get a social security number, [which then] allows us to get [a] driver’s license and a workers permit,” Rubio said. Rubio said he always knew he wasn’t from the United States. However, it wasn’t until his sophomore year of high school that he realized what this meant for him and others in his situation. “Junior and sophomore year of high school is when everybody starts getting their driver’s license, [and] the conversation of college starts picking up,” Rubio said. “I remember seeing all my friends be able to do all these things I wasn’t able to.” According to the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, DACA recipients are not eligible for federally funded financial aid including loans, grants and scholarships. DACA recipients also have to pay out-of-state tuition at public institutions. Some states allow them to pay in-state tuition; however, Georgia is not one of those states. “The financial barriers are enormous so for a really long time I did not think I would be able to go to college at all,” Rubio said. Mercer University is a private institution, therefore DACA recipients like Rubio can receive merit-based scholarships like other students. The number of DACA recipients attending Mercer is not known. Trump’s administration says DACA is an overreach of power. “DACA was effectuated by the previous administration through executive action, without proper statutory authority and with no established end-date, after Congress’ repeated rejection of proposed legislation that would have accomplished a similar result,”said Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a public letter to Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke. “Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch.” The administration said there is a six-month delay on the termination of DACA giving time for Congress to vote to make a long term legislative decision. “Dreamers” and other advocates are pushing for the approval of Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act, also known as the DREAM Act. The bill was introduced to the Senate in 2001 and has been rejected several times. “They’re using DACA as a political football. I don’t believe it is a political matter necessarily, it should be treated like a humanitarian matter,” Rubio said. Mercer University has declined to comment regarding the announcement.

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 18 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images Originally published on September 17, 2017 4:02 pm 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. © 2017 WNPR News</text>

      <title>This Week: Trump’s UN Reform!</title>
      <text>Will he do it? Did anyone ask him? I hope not. Tuesday, September 19, 2017, should be a landmark day. The day Donald Trump makes his debut on stage at the United Nations.
Traditionally, the US president and other world leaders address the opening of the UN General Assembly each September.
This year diplomats the world over anxiously await Trump’s remarks. How can he square his “America First” schtick with the global mandate of the United Nations.
Of course, he can’t. While Donald may strain to read scripted platitudes from the teleprompter panels before him, his true feelings about the UN, shall we say, precede him.
Trump long ago derided the United Nations for its “utter weakness and incompetence.” He has called the UN a “club” where people “get together, talk and have a good time.” Sounds like Mar-A-Lago. Maybe he will bring chocolate cake.
But I know what Trump will say at his inaugural UN address. Early reports say he has a program for UN reform. Unfortunately, the only UN reform he cares about is its decor.
Case in point, the above Tweet from October 2012 (which would have been just a few weeks after that year’s General Assembly. Donald no doubt watched snippets of it on Fox News.)
“The cheap 12 inch sq. marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me. I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me,” he posted.
These are the tiles Trump is gritching about. See, right there behind Trump’s recurring nightmare, 44th President Barack Obama. (Photo courtesy Voice of America) What arrogance! “I will replace . . .” blah, blah, blah.
I hate to tell him, but that’s not just a tile backdrop. It’s actually an elevated stand for officers presiding over the assembly. See . . .
Imagine what Trump’s hair will look like from that vantage point! (White House Photo by Amanda Lucidon) But Donald has long worried about the structural details of the UN building.
In 2005, the UN announced that needed renovations to the fifty-year-old UN building — which sits on the East River in New York City (sort of down the street and around the corner from Trump Tower) — could cost up to $1.5 billion.
Trump, flush from playing a CEO on TV, rushed in and said he could do the job cheaper and quicker. “I could do it for $500 million, what they’re going to spend $1.6 billion for. The only difference is my job would be better,” he told ABC News.
UN officials questioned whether Trump’s cost-cutting measures would meet their high standards.
Oh well, Trump went on to other things, like “Making America Great Again,” destroying the dignity of the presidency, belittling climate change, fomenting (he would say “formenting”!) chaos, and ignoring the rest of the world.
I don’t think anyone at the UN will ask Donald to change the tiles behind him when he speaks Tuesday. Mostly, delegates will quietly endure his comments while they excitedly wait for French President Emmanuel Macron to make his UN debut.

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 19 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images Originally published on September 17, 2017 3:02 pm 
Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. © 2017 WRKF</text>

      <title>Trump to Campaign for Senator Strange in Alabama</title>
      <text>Donald Trump will visit Alabama next week and campaign for incumbent Senator Luther Strange, who is trailing anti-establishment candidate Roy Moore in the GOP Senate runoff race to replace Jeff Sessions (who was appointed attorney general).
I will be in Huntsville, Alabama, on Saturday night to support Luther Strange for Senate. &quot;Big Luther&quot; is a great guy who gets things done!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2017
Trump endorsed Strange in August, but it was unclear if he would actively campaign for him. After pleas from several GOP senators, including Strange himself, Trump agreed to try and boost the incumbent&apos;s chances.
Moore leads Strange by 14 points in the latest poll. And in an ironic twist, the former state judge is being supported by Trump&apos;s ex-chief of staff, Steve Bannon.
Politico:
Trump’s unexpected move sets the stage for a showdown between the president and his recently departed chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who is all-in for Moore. Bannon has cast the Alabama race as an-important clash between grass-roots conservatives and the Washington establishment — and a test for whether other incumbent senators can be successfully challenged by insurgents in 2018.
In response, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other incumbent senators — including Strange himself — have leaned on the president for more help.
Strange spoke several times with Trump by phone last week and asked him to visit before the election. In one of the calls, Strange told the president that he wanted him to come to Alabama but understood that Trump was focused on a pair of devastating hurricanes, according to three people briefed on the discussion. During the 30-minute conversation, Trump told Strange he supported him but was unsure what he could do.
Strange also pitched Vice President Mike Pence. During a recent conversation, the senator gave Pence an update on how the race was going and contended public polling numbers showing him behind shouldn’t be taken seriously, said two people familiar with the discussion. Strange said he’d be appreciative of anything the White House could do. But there was still no commitment.
“The president is extremely popular here. His approval numbers are in the mid-80s among Republicans,” said Blake Harris, a Republican strategist in the state. “Even more, he&apos;s got a record of drawing huge crowds in this state — so a visit could definitely make a difference in what is predicted to be a pretty low turnout election.”
Strange’s Senate colleagues got in on the push, too. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who is up for reelection in 2018 and faces the prospect of a primary challenge, spoke extensively with Trump on Friday and urged him to get involved, according to two people familiar with the conversation. And this week, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) told White House Chief of Staff John Kelly in a phone call that he’d love to see the president head to Alabama for Strange, said two people briefed on the discussion. Kelly told Inhofe that no decision had been made.

      <text>The Bill Press Show Thought-provoking insights from the left side of the political aisle. THE BACKSTORY: Trump to Alabama to help Strange, sets up TRUMP v. Bannon — TRUMP calls Kim Jong-un ‘rocket man’ — SUNDAY BEST — FEINSTEIN: Russia probe might take another year and a half — B’DAY: David Litt September 17, 2017 This post was originally published on this site Playbookers 
Good Sunday morning. TRUMP TO ALABAMA — ALEX ISENSTADT GETS THE BACKSTORY —“Trump takes on Bannon in Alabama Senate showdown: If Luther Strange loses, many Republicans fear it would trigger a wave of primary challenges against GOP incumbents next year”: “President Donald Trump’s decision Saturday to intervene in the Alabama special election followed weeks of pleas from senior Republicans who fear that a loss will invite a wave of primary challenges against GOP incumbents and damage the party in the 2018 midterms. 
“The national party had mounted a full-court press ahead of the Sept. 26 election to persuade the president to make a late visit to the state, where controversial former judge Roy Moore has opened a significant lead over incumbent Sen. Luther Strange. Trump remains popular in Alabama even as his support has diminished elsewhere. … Story Continued Below 
“Trump’s unexpected move sets the stage for a showdown between the president and his recently departed chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who is all-in for Moore. Bannon has cast the Alabama race as an-important clash between grass-roots conservatives and the Washington establishment — and a test for whether other incumbent senators can be successfully challenged by insurgents in 2018.” http://politi.co/2hafSi3 
— WAPO’S MICHAEL SCHERER and MATEA GOLD: “‘It’s shaping up to be McConnell, the Senate Leadership Fund and the Chamber against Bannon,’ said Scott Reed, the senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ‘And we will take that fight.’… Reed echoed the criticism of Bannon for breaking with Trump. ‘He is turning into a rallying point for the alt-right, which is kind of bizarre because half of what he does is damage his former client and friend, whom he served as chief strategist for,’ Reed said.” http://wapo.st/2x773j8

CLIMATE WATCH —“Trump Administration Seeks to Avoid Withdrawal From Paris Climate Accord, International Climate Officials Say: White House spokeswoman says ‘no change’ in U.S. position on deal,” by WSJ’s Emre Peker: “Trump administration officials said Saturday the U.S. wouldn’t pull out of the Paris Agreement, offering to re-engage in the international deal to fight climate change, according to multiple officials at a global warming summit. The U.S. position on reviewing the terms of its participation in the landmark accord came during a meeting of more than 30 ministers led by Canada, China and the European Union in Montreal. … U.S. officials in Montreal, led by White House senior adviser Everett Eissenstat, broached revising U.S. climate-change goals, two participants said, signaling a compromise that would keep the U.S. at the table even if it meant weakening the international effort. 
“Still, the move would maintain international unity behind the painstakingly negotiated Paris accord, after Mr. Trump suggested he might seek a new agreement. … In a statement Saturday afternoon, a White House spokeswoman said the administration’s position on Paris had not changed, but also noted that the president’s stance on withdrawing from the deal had never been set in stone. ‘There has been no change in the U.S.’s position on the Paris agreement,’ said deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters. ‘As the president has made abundantly clear, the U.S. is withdrawing unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country.’” http://on.wsj.com/2frk9h4 
THE LATEST ON THE LONDON ATTACK —“UK police arrest 2nd man in London subway attack case,” by AP’s Gregory Katz in London: “Police said Sunday that a 21-year-old man was arrested late Saturday night in Hounslow in west London and is being held under the Terrorism Act. He is being questioned at a south London police station but has not been charged or identified. Two men are now in custody for possible roles in the bombing attack on a rush-hour subway train Friday morning that injured 29 people in London. An 18-year-old man was arrested Saturday in the departure area of the port of Dover, where ferries leave for France.” http://bit.ly/2xHnpzL

COMING ATTRACTIONS — THIS WEEK IN TURTLE BAY … 
— ON FOX NEWS SUNDAY, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR H.R. MCMASTER said the three themes Trump will hit on in his maiden speech at the U.N. are protecting American people, promoting American prosperity and promoting accountability and sovereignty. 
—“Tillerson heads to U.N. gathering with Haley waiting in the wings,” by Annie Karni: “The disagreement among Trump administration officials and Washington’s foreign policy intelligentsia is not about if but rather when U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley eclipsed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as America’s top diplomat. As President Donald Trump heads to New York for his first United Nations General Assembly, the weeklong gathering is being viewed as the most public test yet for the shrunken diplomat at Foggy Bottom – an opportunity for Tillerson to reassert himself by the president’s side as something more than a bean-counter, or risk being overshadowed by Haley on the most high-profile stage to date. 
“It would be unprecedented for a U.N. ambassador to upstage a secretary of state at the diplomatic Super Bowl. UNGA is typically a frenetic week of parties, speeches, bilateral meetings and Manhattan traffic jams, during which the ambassador cedes the yearlong spotlight she enjoys at U.N. headquarters to officials higher up the food chain. But ‘unprecedented’ is the Trump administration’s unofficial slogan. And Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, is seen as one of its most ambitious players, competing for prominence against a former Exxon Mobil CEO, who has been criticized for accepting the lead role at the State Department only to oversee a dramatic shrinkage of its budget and influence.” http://politi.co/2fskIY0 
—“Trump Admin Doesn’t Expect Israeli-Palestinian Peace Breakthrough During U.N. General Assembly,” by Haaretz’s Amir Tibon and Barak Ravid: “The Trump administration does not expect any kind of breakthrough regarding the Israeli-Palestinian peace process during the United Nations General Assembly this week despite their overall optimism, a senior White House official told Haaretz on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the diplomatic gathering, but the senior official noted that ‘this week is not about the peace effort.’… 
“The official noted that Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, recently returned from a visit to the region together with senior advisers Jason Greenblatt and Dina Powell. The official called the visit ‘very productive’ and said that ‘those peace conversations are continuing at a steady pace and will be mostly separate from the United Nations meetings.’” http://bit.ly/2xJcy8g 
REMEMBER HIM? — ERIC CANTOR in the NYT: “How to End the Immigration Wars”: “Only Congress can fix this mess. It should do so by providing a path for law-abiding Dreamers to obtain a green card and ultimately, full citizenship. 
“In exchange for a much improved program for Dreamers , Congress should significantly increase America’s border security by funding additional personnel, technology and physical resources at our border. While President Trump’s “wall” has gotten all the political attention, much of the border can be secured more quickly and efficiently by other means. In addition, Congress should require the institution of a comprehensive biometric entry-exit system to prevent visa overstays.” http://nyti.ms/2xIVjUM 
— THIS IS MILES from where the debate is at this moment. 
CARL HULSE speaks to SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY.) on the NYT’s “The New Washington” podcast: ON STEVE BANNON DECLARING WAR ON THE ESTABLISHMENT: “I don’t have any reaction to it.” http://nyti.ms/2wyFlHO 
BLAST FROM THE PAST —“Sources: Michael Grimm to run for old seat in Congress,” by NY1 News: “NY1 has learned that former New York congressman Michael Grimm will run for his old seat, less than 16 months after he was released from federal prison. Sources said Grimm will hold a rally Oct. 1 in New Dorp, where he is expected to announce his candidacy for next year’s Republican primary against current Rep. Dan Donovan, who represents Staten Island and parts of south Brooklyn. 
“A federal tax fraud conviction appeared to end Michael Grimm’s political career nearly three years ago, after he admitted to paying several workers off-the books at a Manhattan restaurant that he owned. But after he resigned his seat and served seven months in prison, Grimm began taking steps back toward the political arena. He created a new Twitter account, posting opinions and politician-style photos.” http://bit.ly/2y6O314

WHAT MITT ROMNEY’S READING —“Orrin Hatch, 83, says another campaign hinges on his health: ‘I’m older but you know, nothing stops me,’” by Salt Lake Tribune’s Tommy Burr: “Hatch, who describes himself as ‘a tough old bird’ at 83, acknowledges that his age has affected him — though he says it hasn’t slowed him down, and a medical report provided by his office says he’s physically fit. The Utah Republican is the third oldest member of the Senate, and his office frequently jokes on social media about the senator’s age, quipping that he’s been around since the Civil War or the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. … As the longest-serving Republican senator, Hatch is the Senate president pro tempore and third in line for the presidency — a position that earns him a round-the-clock security detail. 
“Hatch says he wakes up around 5 a.m., works out on a stationary bike and does some stretching exercises. … Hatch acknowledges his eyes have been bugging him of late — they’re frequently red and staffers print his remarks in large type to make sure he can read them — and he wears a hearing aid in his right ear. When he speaks, he’s often hard to hear, a point the senator attributes to his job. … Hatch’s schedule on that day his office arranged for The Tribune to spend with him ran 27 items long, starting at 6:25 a.m. and wrapping up at 7 p.m. He was almost constantly on the move, from hearings to meetings to calls.” http://bit.ly/2wnwUUw 
SUNDAY BEST — GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS speaks with BRITISH PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY on ABC’S “THIS WEEK”: STEPHANOPOULOS: “You’re coming to the United States this week. You’re speaking to the United Nations. You’re relatively unknown to most Americans. What’s the most important thing you want them to know about what you’re trying to achieve?” MAY: “Well, what I’m — there are two things. One is this issue of ensuring that we can stop terrorists from plotting online, plotting on the internet, and that we can stop the spread of the hateful extremist ideology, which can inspire terrorism. I think that’s really important for us. And another issue I’m going to be talking about is something that most people probably don’t think about, don’t think happens. It’s what I call modern slavery, which is when people are being effectively taken into servitude, into slavery, for sexual exploitation or labor exploitation. It’s happening under our noses.” 
— ON TRUMP: STEPHANOPOULOS: “You’ve also got the travel ban. His comments after Charlottesville. Pulling out of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. Big differences.” MAY: “Well, I think the point about the special relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. is that when we do disagree we’re able to say so. And — pretty bluntly. And I’m — for example, on the Paris issue that you talk about, the Paris Climate Change Agreement, I’ve made very clear I was dismayed when America decided to pull out of that. And I — as I’ve said to President Trump, I hope that they’ll be able– able to find a way for America to come back into the agreement.” 
STEPHANOPOULOS: “Do you still think he’ll be able to come here for a state visit or is that just not gonna happen?” MAY: “No, Her Majesty the Queen– issued the invitation. The president has accepted it. It’s just a question of getting dates to — and sorting out the logistics.” STEPHANOPOULOS: “So it has nothing to do with the opposition here in the United Kingdom?” MAY: “No, this is — this is about finding dates when — the invitation was issued and the invitation has been accepted.” 
DANA BASH speaks to U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: BASH: “Well I think General Mattis will take care of it. You’re talking about the Pentagon and you’re talking about a military option. Is that what ‘fire and fury’ meant?” HALEY: “You have to ask the President what fire and fury meant. But I think we all know that basically if North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed. And we all know that. And none of us want that. None of us want war. But we also have to look at the fact that you are dealing with someone who is being reckless, irresponsible and is continuing to give threats not only to the United States, but to all of their allies. So something is going to have to be done. We’re trying every other possibility that we have but there’s a whole lot of military options on the table.” 
— DANA also spoke to SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: BASH: “Do you have any idea when that’s going to happen, that public testimony from Donald Trump Jr.?” FEINSTEIN: “Well, it will be this fall. I know that for sure. Things keep changing, not by design, but by just the press of other business on the committee. And I think people have to anticipate — I know because, as I walk through the halls, there’s a rush of press, you know, with question after question. It may take a long time. This could take a year, a year-and-a-half, if not more.” 
H.R. MCMASTER to CHRIS WALLACE on “FOX NEWS SUNDAY” on NORTH KOREA: “It really depends on how we see this threat continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have. We are out of road because in the past the approach taken to the problem of North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long drawn-out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement. An agreement that, then, the North Korean regime breaks. And with that agreement does though that’s particularly dangerous oftentimes – what has all the time in the past – is lock in the status quo as the new normal. And this regime is so close now to threatening the United States and others with a nuclear weapon, that we really have to move with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy and on preparing if necessary a military option.” 
ATTN. NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER — CHUCK TODD spoke with SEN. TOM COTTON (R-ARK.) on “MEET THE PRESS” : “[I]f you pass the so-called Dream Act it’ll be the single biggest amnesty in the history of the United States. Even bigger than the 1986 amnesty which Ronald Reagan said was his biggest mistake in office.” 
A message from CTIA and America’s wireless industry: Tomorrow’s 5G networks will create 3 million jobs, add $500 billion to the economy, and fuel innovation and entrepreneurialism across every sector. If policymakers move quickly to release more spectrum and modernize infrastructure rules, the wireless industry stands ready to invest $275 billion to build these next-gen networks, according to Accenture. This will drive breakthrough advancements in remote health care, connected vehicles, energy, education and beyond—making our lives better and safer. But the race to deploy 5G wireless networks is underway—and we’re at a critical moment. The EU, China, Japan, South Korea and others are doing everything they can to win. If policymakers act now, the U.S. can continue our global leadership in wireless. Learn how at CTIA.org . 
THE OPPOSITION —“California tears into Trump,” by California Playbooker David Siders in Sacramento: “Ripping into Donald Trump in the final hours of this year’s legislative session, California lawmakers passed measures urging Congress to censure the president, bucking his immigration policies and seeking to force him to release his tax returns. They also formally called on Trump ‘to publicly apologize to all Americans for his racist and bigoted behavior.’ If there was any question about the location of the nerve center of the anti-Trump resistance, it was settled with a defiant fusillade of legislation Friday and Saturday memorializing California’s antipathy toward the president. 
“The end-of-session rush of bills served as a reminder of the limitations of the president’s recent diplomacy with Democrats in Washington — and of an unrelenting effort to keep pressure on the president from afar. ‘The issue of resistance is beyond the symbolism,’ Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León said after the session officially closed. ‘There’s real lives at stake … and I think that a lot of other municipalities, as well as other states, are looking towards California … to be the leader of this resistance.’” http://politi.co/2wyH7s7

It was a database he founded in 1992 and ran from an apartment in Yonkers, and it helped cartoonists license their work for thousands of dollars a month. But when Condé Nast bought the Bank from Mankoff in 1997, the money began to dry up and the model began to fail.” http://bit.ly/2x2R6uk

And it has vastly expanded the audience for conversations that used to happen in small communities of relatively similar people, replacing them with one-to-many interactions with people who potentially have a wide array of views, and weak or even no direct personal ties.” https://yhoo.it/2h823k9

In the same way, readers put up with unintelligibility, obsessiveness, painful truths, lies, bad grammar—if, in compensation, the writer allows them to savor rare emotions and dangerous sensations.” http://bit.ly/2h88UtJ … $16.19 on Amazon http://amzn.to/2x2WaPm

      <title>Donald Trump Retweets Hitting Hillary Clinton&apos;s Back with a Golf Ball</title>
      <text>On Sunday morning, President Donald Trump&apos;s Twitter account shared a tweet with a .gif showing him hitting Hillary Clinton with a golf ball.
&quot;Donald Trump&apos;s amazing golf swing. #CrookedHillary,&quot; Mike, whose account name is &quot;fuctupmind,&quot; tweeted.

President Trump retweeted the message.
YouTube screenshot of President Trump retweeting a poorly made internet video.
The .gif featured a poorly made video of Trump swinging his golf club at a golf course, shooting a golf ball into the air. The next video showed Hillary Clinton&apos;s infamous trip and fall as she entered her private plane during the 2016 presidential election.
As a propaganda tool, the video is brilliant — showing Trump knocking Hillary down at a pivotal moment. In the election, the video of Clinton&apos;s tripping sparked fears about her health, helping to present her as unfit for the presidency.
But the election is over. Although Clinton has strolled into the media circus again, even rewriting the very message of George Orwell&apos;s classic 1984 to attack the president, this retweet, seen as Trump&apos;s response, comes across as petty and vindictive.
Then again, such a retweet is not without precedent. Last month, the president retweeted an image of the &quot;Trump Train&quot; running over CNN.
The worst thing about such unforced mistakes is that the media will focus a great deal of time on Trump&apos;s vindictiveness, rather than covering the truly important stories that are developing — the corruption trial of Democrat Senator Robert Menendez and the efforts to achieve tax reform, for example.

      <title>Freedom Rider: Hurricanes and Capitalism</title>
      <text>Margaret Kimberley , BAR editor and senior columnist 
“No one can expect a helping hand unless they are already among the haves.” Recent hurricanes in Texas and Florida reveal a great deal about the United States and how little it does for its people. Of course hurricane winds destroy material things and injure and kill humans. But natural disasters also destroy the myths of American democracy, exceptionalism and greatness. The people of Houston live in a city which has no zoning regulations, where petro chemical companies control politics and therefore have an unjust impact on their lives. Floridians live under a similar system, where right wing politics rule and no effort is spared to punish people because they are poor. By every measure, America is a country where millions struggle on a daily basis because they have little or no income. Democrat Bill Clinton ended the right to public assistance twenty years ago and of course poverty has increased. Even American workers are poor, with half of them earning less than $31,000 per year. An unknown number don’t work at all, with official statistics omitting the plight of people who may not have worked for years if ev er. “American workers are poor, with half of them earning less than $31,000 per year.” These truths are too inconvenient to be exposed in a country that loves to love itself. But the propaganda of a great country is harder to promote when Texans and Floridians suffer not just because of nature but because the system is not meant to help them. In America everyone is on their own in a dystopian survival of the fittest nightmare. The only money that arrives for disaster victims comes from dubious private charities like the Red Cross. In an ideal society the government would repair homes, replace lost property and take other actions to make people whole again. Twelve years after hurricane Katrina little has changed. When disaster strikes the Red Cross fills its coffers as well meaning individuals contribute in hopes of assisting others in need. The organization has been exposed as a racket, providing a meal and a blanket but little else, even as it markets itself as the most reliable charity in times of crisis. I f America is the world’s only super power it is because it has the largest military in the world and trillions of dollars in its treasury. Its military isn’t mobilized to move people away from natural disaster because that is not why it is exists. The military industrial complex has two purposes; making money for corporate interests and intimidating the rest of the world into complying with American dictates. This is a rich country, but the presence of a strong currency and rich individuals do nothing to help people devastated by acts of nature. “The Red Cross has been exposed as a racket, providing a meal and a blanket but little else.” The suffering in Texas and Florida shines a light on everyone’s condition in a dog eat dog society. No one can expect a helping hand unless they are already among the haves. Democrats and Republicans work together to reduce the tax burden on the wealthy but do nothing to raise the minimum wage. Corporations like Walmart always get tax relief to operate and also governmental relief for their impoverished employees. Cities and states race to the bottom to compete for the favors of the already wealthy and waste the public’s money in dubious ventures. Yet after all the bowing and scraping to wealthy individuals and corporations the masses of people can expect nothing when they are in need. Evacuation plans don’t accommodate the needs of poor people. Those in already dire straits may not be able to access shelter, if any can be found. Floridians fleeing hurricane Irma often found no room at the inn when they heeded warnings from officials. The impact of climate change is and should be a topic for discussion in the wake of a devastating tropical storm season. It is easy to point fingers at Donald Trump, who has already chosen to remove the United States from the most recent international climate agreement. But Trump has only been president for eight months. The damage to the ecosystem began decades ago and the pre-Trump Republicans and Democrats had no interest in acting to save all life on the planet. “Cities and states race to the bottom to compete for the favors of the already wealthy.” Democrats like Clinton and Barack Obama talked a good game, but they acquiesced as much as Republicans did to the fossil fuel and other industries that are responsible for global warming. They allowed oil drilling offshore and on public lands. They promoted the use of coal. They did so because they follow the rules set by corporate interests. Because capital is in control tropical storms and droughts are occurring with greater severity and imperiling life around the world. It isn’t surprising that so little is done to protect humanity in these circumstances. The same system that creates catastrophes is unlikely to stem the consequences created by them.

      <title>Feinstein: We intend for Trump Jr. to testify publicly</title>
      <text>11 min ago ( … ) 
The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee said Sunday it was her and the Republican committee chairman&apos;s intention to bring Donald Trump Jr. before the committee for public testimony. 
California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in an interview on CNN&apos;s &quot;State of the Union&quot; that she was beginning to review the transcript of a lengthy private session President Donald Trump&apos;s eldest son had earlier this month with committee staff, in which he discussed his June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower. 
&quot;I think it&apos;s Senator (Chuck) Grassley&apos;s intent, and it&apos;s certainly my intent, to have him before the committee in the open and be able to ask some questions under oath,&quot; she told guest anchor Dana Bash. 
Feinstein said the panel&apos;s Democratic members had taken on two new investigators to assist with their side of the investigation, which she said dealt largely with questions of obstruction of justice and what connection, if any, Trump&apos;s associates had with Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election. 
Feinstein said the committee would probably subpoena Paul Manafort, Trump&apos;s former campaign chairman, if he would not agree to appear before the committee. 
&quot;We will likely do that if he refuses to come before the committee,&quot; Feinstein said of a potential subpoena. 
Asked if there was any indication Trump&apos;s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner played any role in Russia-linked Facebook ads, Feinstein said, &quot;No, not at this time.&quot; 
Feinstein also advised the public to be patient as the investigations continue to go on for the foreseeable future. 
&quot;This could take a year, a year and a half, if not more,&quot; Feinstein said. DACA and reelection 
Feinstein addressed the potential agreement on immigration between Trump and Democratic leaders, calling it a &quot;bit of regular order.&quot; 
Trump dined on Wednesday with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. After the dinner, the two Democrats announced a possible deal on codifying protections for young undocumented immigrants from deportation. 
Although the Trump administration said earlier this month it would rescind an Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program within six months, Trump said he wants Congress to deliver a solution. 
Feinstein praised the dinner talk between Trump and the Democratic leaders. 
&quot;I would say this is a start because big bills have to be bipartisan,&quot; Feinstein said. 
She noted the large population of DACA recipients in her home state of California and spoke of their importance and strength. 
&quot;They are amazing young people,&quot; Feinstein said. 
Feinstein, 84, is up for reelection in 2018, and as the nation&apos;s oldest living senator, questions continue to mount on whether or not she will retire. Asked if she would run for reelection, Feinstein declined to say one way or the other. 
&quot;We&apos;ll see,&quot; Feinstein said.</text>

      <title>Second Man Arrested In Connection To London Attack</title>
      <text>By Miles Parks • 6 hours ago Forensics officers investigate a property in relation to Friday&apos;s terror attack in London. The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to &quot;critical&quot; after the attack, but it was lowered to &quot;severe&quot; on Sunday.

Police in London say they&apos;ve arrested a second man in connection to Friday&apos;s attack on the city&apos;s subway. 
The 21-year-old was arrested in west London around 11:30 p.m. Saturday under the Terrorism Act, the Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. He was taken to a south London police station for questioning but he has yet to be charged or identified. 
As NPR reported on Friday , 29 people were injured at the Parsons Green subway station in Fullham when an explosion went off in a train car. The Islamic State&apos;s Amaq news agency said the militant group was responsible for the attack, but that claim could not be independently verified. 
Police arrested an 18-year-old on Saturday in Dover as well, in connection to the &quot;cowardly&quot; Friday rush hour attack, as British Prime Minister Theresa May called it. 
&quot;Photos posted on social media show a white plastic bucket with flames coming out of the top — along with wires,&quot; NPR&apos;s Frank Langfitt reported for our Newscast Unit. &quot;The bucket is sitting next to a subway train door. A purse, apparently abandoned by a fleeing passenger, sits in the foreground.&quot; 
On Sunday morning, authorities were searching a property in Stanwell, a suburb southwest of London, in connection to the second arrest. They also earlier searched a property in Sunbury in relation to the first arrest. 
The Sunbury property belongs to an elderly couple who have taken foster children in for years, reports the Associated Press: 
&quot;Ronald Jones, 88, and his wife Penelope Jones, 71, have been honored by Queen Elizabeth II for their work with children in need of a stable home... 
&quot;A friend, Alison Griffiths, said they are &apos;great pillars of the community&apos; who have taken in several hundred children in the last 40 years. 
&quot;The entire neighborhood around their house was evacuated as a precaution when the search began Saturday. Residents were allowed to return home Sunday but the Jones&apos; house remains cordoned off.&quot; 
President Donald Trump has also riled a bit of tension as authorities in the U.K. continue their investigation. Trump tweeted that the perpetrators of Friday&apos;s attack were &quot;in the sights of Scotland Yard.&quot; 
Britain&apos;s Home Secretary Amber Rudd, called the comments unhelpful and &quot;pure speculation,&quot; according to The Guardian . 
When asked if her comments could be construed as a message to the president to stop tweeting, Rudd responded, &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;d be the first person to say that, would I?&quot; 
&quot;We don&apos;t want any speculation on an ongoing operation,&quot; she added. 
The threat level in the United Kingdom was raised to critical immediately after the attack, meaning another attack was &quot; expected imminently ,&quot; but it was lowered to severe on Sunday. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. Our Broadcast Partners</text>

      <title>Quora: Thoughts on Obama&apos;s Letter to Trump</title>
      <text>Quora Questions are part of a partnership between Newsweek and Quora , through which we&apos;ll be posting relevant and interesting answers from Quora contributors throughout the week. Read more about the partnership here . Answer from Dave Consiglio :
What do you think about Barack Obama&apos;s departing letter to Donald Trump?
Trending: Nikki Haley Pledges &apos;A New Day For The U.N.&apos; Ahead Of Trump&apos;s First Address
I think it was a waste of perfectly good ink.
Bear with me.
Obama’s letter reflects in crystal clarity the primary difference between the two men. Obama was by no means a perfect person, but he understood the importance of civility, kindness, and the limits of partisanship.
His successor does not.

Obama knew that you never want to burn your bridges unless you have no other options. He complimented Republicans, tried to reach across the aisle, and was never critical of the personal lives of his political enemies. He had disagreements with John McCain, for example, and he said critical things about his politics during the ’08 election, but he never insulted the man himself. On the contrary, he was very respectful of his military and government service. He was very careful to delineate between the person and the politics. Even with the ACA, he worked very hard to get the GOP on board with his plans. Eventually, seeing that they were unified against him, he got what he could get from the Democrats.
By contrast, Trump seems to burn bridges for no reason, even with his political allies. He insults Democrats constantly, and Republicans pretty frequently, too, particularly during the election. He mocked John McCain for being captured during war, and insulted Marco Rubio for his short stature (Side note: he’s 5′9″). He also says blatantly racist, sexist, and homophobic things on a regular basis, insulting whole swathes of people that include potential voters, not just for him but for the legislators that can help him further his agenda.

When enough time has passed, I think Obama will be remembered as one of our better presidents. He may not be mentioned in the same breath as Lincoln and Washington, but his successes (negotiating a nuclear deal in Iran, opening relations with Cuba, making massive progress on government healthcare, pushing for and eventually seeing marriage equality, transgender service in the military, and general improvement in LGBTQ+ rights in the federal government, getting us out of one war and moving us toward the ending of another, and (most importantly) dragging the country from the grips of the worst economic recession in 75 years to economic security and growth in less than 8 years) will place him high on the list of successful presidents.

Trump will be remembered as a man who tried to increase racism, nationalism, and elitism. A man who banned transgender people from the military, tried to build a wall to keep out “illegals”, who tacitly endorsed the KKK, and who furthered the practices of racial profiling, voter disenfranchisement, and racial discrimination in general. A man who tried to reduce the amount of healthcare citizens could get, all the while decreasing taxes on the people who can most afford to pay them. I think it’s very likely he’ll be remembered as a divider, an oppressor, and a failure.
What do I think of Obama’s letter? I think it was a well-intentioned attempt to convey the gravity of being the president to a man without the mental capacity to understand that gravity. It was the erudite thoughts of an educated scholar and gentleman being passed on to a man who admires professional wrestling and beauty pageants. It was the optimistic hopes of a man who clearly cherished his wife, daughters, and women in general being passed on to a man who disposes of wives, comments on his daughter’s “hotness”, and grabs women… inappropriately.
It was a waste of perfectly good ink.
Thanks, President Obama, for trying. Maybe I’m wrong on this one. Maybe it wasn’t a waste. But, judging by where we are right now, I think the letter was for Presidential Posterity, not for President Posterior.

      <title>Trump advisers warn North Korea to give up weapons programs - Sun, 17 Sep 2017 PST</title>
      <text>Trump advisers warn North Korea to give up weapons programs Sun., Sept. 17, 2017, 8:27 a.m. United Nations General Assembly Whats Ahead Carolyn Kaster AP AP FILE - In this Sept. 15, 2017 photo, President Donald Trump waves as he walks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington to Marine One for the short trip to Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press) By Darlene Superville Associated Press SMS 
SOMERSET, N.J. – Top advisers to President Donald Trump on Sunday warned North Korea to give up its missile and nuclear weapons programs and to quit making threats against the U.S. and its allies or face destruction. 
The warnings came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to continue the weapons programs, saying his country is nearing its goal of “equilibrium” in military force with the United States. They also come as world leaders begin arriving in New York for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly this week, where the topic of North Korea will be high on the agenda. 
Trump will be making his first appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, his biggest moment on the world stage since January’s inauguration. He is scheduled to address the world body, which he has criticized as weak and incompetent, on Tuesday. 
Trump tweeted Sunday that he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed North Korea during their latest telephone conversation on Saturday. Trump spoke with Moon from his New Jersey golf club, where aides said he spent the weekend preparing for his U.N. debut. 
U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Kim is “going to have to give up his nuclear weapons because the president has said he’s not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon.” 
Asked if that meant Trump would launch a military strike, McMaster said “he’s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.” 
Kim has threatened Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, and has fired two missiles over Japan, a U.S. ally in Asia, including one missile that was launched on Friday. North Korea also recently tested its most powerful bomb. 
The U.N. Security Council has voted unanimously twice in recent weeks to tighten economic sanctions on North Korea, including targeting shipments of oil and other fuel used in missile testing. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said North Korea was starting to “feel the pinch.” 
But she also warned of a tougher U.S. response in the future, saying the Security Council has “pretty much exhausted” all of its options and that she would be happy to turn the matter over to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis “because he has plenty of military options.” 
Mattis said earlier this month, after Kim tested a hydrogen bomb, that the U.S. will answer any threat from the North with a “massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming.” 
Trump has threatened to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea. Haley said that wasn’t an empty threat from the president but, when asked, she declined to describe the president’s intentions. 
“If North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed and we all know that and none of us want that,” Haley said. “None of us want war. But we also have to look at the fact that you are dealing with someone who is being reckless, irresponsible and is continuing to give threats not only to the United States, but to all their allies, so something is going to have to be done.” 
In Sunday’s tweet, Trump said he asked Moon about “Rocket Man” – an apparent reference to Kim. Trump also tweeted that long lines for gas are forming in North Korea and called it “too bad.” 
The White House said after Trump’s tweet that he and Moon are committed to strengthening deterrence and defense capabilities, and maximizing economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. 
Trump plans to sit down with Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the U.N. General Assembly session this week. 
Haley spoke on CNN’s “State of the Union” and McMaster appeared on ABC’s “This Week.” Published: Sept. 17, 2017, 8:27 a.m.</text>

      <title>Trump mocks Kim Jong Un, dubs him ‘Rocket Man’ in Sunday morning tweet</title>
      <text>By David Nakamura 
NEW YORK — President Donald Trump is calling Kim Jong Un names — the “Rocket Man.”
The president stuck the moniker on the North Korea dictator in a Sunday morning tweet ahead of Trump’s scheduled arrival here in Sunday evening for the U.N. General Assembly, the annual gathering of more than 120 world leaders.
I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017 

Trump, who has spent two nights at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., also revealed that he spoke with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who will join Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for a trilateral dinner this week in New York to collaborate on addressing North Korea’s growing nuclear and ballistic missile threats. The White House said Trump and Moon discussed North Korea’s continued defiance of the international community and “committed to continuing to take steps to strengthen deterrence and defense capabilities and to maximize economic and diplomatic pressure.”
The president’s Twitter snark came two weeks after Kim’s regime undertook its biggest nuclear test to date, an explosion that analysts estimate at 250 kilotons, nearly 17 times the size of the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima in 1945. Radar satellite images show that the test was powerful enough to sink a roughly 85-acre area on the peak of a mountain above the tunnels where the test is thought to have taken place.
Kim Jong Un wants military &apos;equilibrium&apos; with U.S. to make Americans &apos;dare not talk&apos; about their options Asked about the test on Thursday, Trump said he’s working with China to continue to exert more pressure on Pyongyang, but he declined to elaborate.
“We are working on different things. I can’t tell you, obviously, what I’m working on. But believe me, the people of this country will be very, very safe,” Trump told reporters. “I think that a lot of effort is being put into this. We’re looking at what’s going on. As we speak, we are literally at it right now, and you will be seeing what we’ll be doing.”
North Korea’s growing ability to potentially reach the continental United States with a ballistic missile, which could be mounted with a miniature nuclear device, has increased the urgency for the Trump administration. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, pointed to the world body’s two recent votes to impose more severe economic sanctions on the North as signs that the international community is united in its condemnation.
“What we are seeing is they continue to be provocative, they continue to be reckless. And at that point, there’s not a whole lot the Security Council is going to be able to do from here when you’ve cut 90 per cent of the trade and 30 per cent of the oil,” she said, before implying that military options remain on the table.
“So, having said that, I have no problem kicking it to General (Jim) Mattis, because I think he has plenty of options,” Haley said of Trump’s defence secretary.
She also told reporters that “it’s time to be serious” as Trump and his team prepared for their General Assembly debut.

      <title>Haley: Diplomacy efforts with North Korea &apos;pretty much exhausted&apos;</title>
      <text>Sept. 17 (UPI) -- Nikki Haley , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Sunday with the United States exhausting diplomatic means against North Korea , &quot;military options&quot; are an alternative.
Haley, speaking on CNN&apos;s State of the Union , said, &quot;We have pretty much exhausted all the things that we could do at the Security Council at this point.&quot; 
Haley told CNN&apos;s Dane Bash she would be &quot;perfectly happy&quot; turning things over to U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
&quot;We wanted to be responsible and go through all diplomatic means to get their attention first,&quot; Haley said. &quot;If that doesn&apos;t work, General [Jim] Mattis will take care of it.&quot;
Last Monday, the U.N. Security Council adopted a new round of sanctions on North Korea after the nation&apos;s sixth and largest nuclear weapons test. On Thursday , North Korea fired a ballistic missile that flew over Japan in the North Pacific and reached a height of 478 miles and distance of about 2,300 miles.
On Friday , Haley told reporters at the White House that North Korea has been &quot;strangled&quot; by sanctions and said military options remain squarely on the table if sanctions are not effective.
On Sunday, she reiterated those views.
&quot;If North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed,&quot; Haley said. &quot;And we all know that, and none of us want that.&quot;
Last month , U.S. President Donald Trump said North Korea &quot;will be met with fire and fury and, frankly, power, the likes of which this world has never seen before&quot; if Kim Jong Un continued to threaten the United States.
&quot;You have to ask the president what fire and fury meant,&quot; Haley said. &quot;But I think we all know that, basically, if North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed.&quot;
On Sunday morning, Trump called the North Korea leader &quot;Rocket Man,&quot; which was a 1972 song sung by Elton John .
He posted on Twitter : &quot;I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night. Asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad!&quot;
National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster , in an interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday , agreed that the United States might need to turn to a military option.
&quot;We are out of road because in the past the approach taken to the problem of North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long drawn-out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement -- an agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks,&quot; McMaster said.
McMaster said Trump&apos;s scheduled speech Tuesday at the U.S. General Assembly in New York will &quot;communicate his vision for America&apos;s role in the world&quot; in three areas: protecting American people, promoting American prosperity and promoting accountability and sovereignty.</text>

      <text>Florida Gov’t Weekly Roundup: Unfathomable 
September 17, 2017 
Days after Hurricane Irma slashed a destructive swath through Florida, it’s still unclear exactly how much damage the state and its inhabitants have suffered. And it might be weeks — or even months — before the massive storm’s impact is known. 
From the Keys to Naples to Jacksonville, Irma wreaked havoc on homes and businesses, turned off lights and air conditioning for more than half the state and caused severe damage in the agriculture industry. 
But the most shocking result of Irma was the deaths of eight elderly nursing home residents — literally across the street from a major hospital — in Hollywood after the nursing facility’s air conditioning stopped working. The tragedy, which drew national attention, created a furor among local and state officials, including Gov. Rick Scott and U.S. Sens. Bill Nelson and Marco Rubio. 
The week brought some other news, but, with more than two-thirds of Florida’s counties qualifying for disaster relief and reeling from Irma, nobody paid much attention. 
By week’s end, power was being steadily restored, many streets were cleared of debris, and cleanup was well underway. 
Now may not be the time to begin the Monday-morning quarterbacking about how — or if — the state could have done better to prepare for the storm or to cope with its aftermath. 
But the heartbreaking deaths of the eight nursing home residents will certainly be at the forefront of the scrutiny. 
“We throw our elderly away,” Bendetta Craig, whose 87-year-old mother lived at The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, said. “That’s my mother, somebody’s mother, somebody’s sister, somebody’s father. They’re not dollar signs.” 
`INEXCUSABLE’ TRAGEDY 
The nursing home deaths left people in Florida and throughout the nation wondering how such an event could happen. 
“Every facility that is charged with caring for patients must take every action and precaution to keep their patients safe — especially patients that are in poor health,” Scott tweeted Wednesday, after the news broke about The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills. 
Scott’s administration shut down admissions to the Broward County facility on Wednesday, after the seniors died and the remaining residents were evacuated. Scott also ordered the Agency for Health Care Administration on Thursday to oust the facility from the Medicaid program. 
“It is clear that this facility cannot be responsible for Florida’s vulnerable patients, and therefore the state will stop them from providing care,” Scott’s office said in a statement announcing the Medicaid decision. 
Local officials have launched a criminal investigation into the deaths, and state agencies are also investigating the situation. Nelson, D-Fla., and Rubio, R-Fla., called on federal health officials to get involved. 
Nelson described it as an “inexcusable tragedy that frail patients would die of heat exhaustion without it being recognized.” 
In a lengthy statement, nursing home administrator Jorge Carballo said the facility did not lose power during Hurricane Irma, but it lost a transformer that powered the air-conditioning system. The statement said the nursing home contacted Florida Power &amp; Light and followed up about when repairs would be made. 
“In compliance with state regulations, the center did have a generator on standby in the event it would be needed to power life safety systems,” Carballo said in the statement. “The center also had seven days of food, water, ice and other supplies, including gas for the generator. Additionally, when the transformer powering the A/C went down, staff set up mobile cooling units and fans to cool the facility. Our staff continually checked on our residents’ well-being — our most important concern — to ensure they were hydrated and as comfortable as possible.” 
The facility is rated “below average” on a federal scorecard that includes information about issues such as inspections, staffing and quality of care. The federal Medicare.gov website includes a Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services report that said a health inspection was conducted by the state March 31 and found a series of deficiencies at the facility. While some of the deficiencies appeared likely to affect few residents, the report indicated other more-serious deficiencies were found in areas such as food safety, disposal of garbage and infection-control programs. 
The Hollywood tragedy also revealed that dozens of nursing homes were without electricity or had been evacuated because of Irma. 
`IT’S GOING TO BE A LONG ROAD’ 
After Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys and the southwestern portion of the state Sunday, curfews were imposed in many areas, much of the Keys remained closed, and millions of people continued to lack electricity as cleanup work was expected to reach into the billions of dollars. 
The state was also coping with intense flooding on both coasts and the interior, where rising rivers left some houses marooned in the middle of marshes. 
Later in the week, tempers flared when officials barred Keys evacuees from returning to the lower islands. 
“I know for our entire state, but especially the Keys, it’s going to be a long road. There is a lot of damage,” Scott said after viewing the damage from the air Monday. “I know everyone wants to get back to normal. I know everyone wants to get started, but you’ve got to be patient. We’ve got to get the first responders to the Keys. We’ve got to get water going again. We’ve got to get electricity going again. We’ve got to get sewers going again. It’s going to take a lot of time.” 
On Tuesday, the governor teamed up with former University of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow to thank volunteers and workers at the state Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee and in hard-hit Lee County. 
“In the midst of a really tough time, you know I think so many people that were hurting have something to hold on to because there were so many volunteers … and they knew there were people in it with them,” Tebow said during the Tallahassee stop. “It doesn’t take away their pain, and it doesn’t take away their fear and doubt of the unknown, but it does give them a little comfort to know that there are people battling with them and loving and supporting them.” 
President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, joined Scott and his wife, Ann, to tour the damage in Southwest Florida on Thursday. 
Trump handed out hoagies to storm-addled survivors in Naples. 
Trump praised Scott and thanked first responders, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the military for how they handled the lead-up to the storm and were dealing with recovery efforts. 
“And I know you’re also in the process, but to think of the incredible power of that storm. And while people unfortunately passed, it was such a small number that nobody would have — people thought thousands and thousands of people may have their lives ended. And the number is a very small number which is a great tribute to you,” the president said. 
`WET FEET’ AND EXTENSIVE DAMAGE 
Parts of Florida’s agriculture industry are in “tatters” as rural communities continue to face severe conditions after the storm, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam said Thursday. 
Putnam said the storm hammered citrus, vegetable and sugarcane growers, though he didn’t put a cost estimate on the damage. And as many farmers and residents of Florida’s rural counties wait for power to be restored, they will soon be inundated with mosquitoes because of water left behind by Irma, he noted. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, the former Georgia governor, will be in Florida on Monday to tour the damage as the state seeks federal aid, Putnam told reporters at the Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee. 
Putnam, a Bartow resident who is running for governor next year, called the impacts “extensive” for growers, particularly those in the struggling citrus industry. Even before Irma, the 2016-2017 orange harvest was down 16 percent from the prior year, while the grapefruit harvest dropped 28 percent in the same time. 
In Southwest Florida, between 70 and 80 percent of fruit “is on the ground,” and widespread flooding will bring further woes, Putnam said. 
“Citrus trees cannot tolerate wet feet. They can’t tolerate wet roots,” he said. “And we will continue to see these numbers of losses grow over time.” 
STORY OF THE WEEK: Hurricane Irma made landfall in the Florida Keys and Southwest Florida on Sunday, leaving a trail of destruction through the state and cutting off power to millions of residents and businesses. 
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “Although the details of these reported deaths are still under investigation, this situation is unfathomable,” — Gov. Rick Scott, after news broke of the deaths of residents of The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills in Broward County.

      <title>Trump advisers warn North Korea to give up weapons programs</title>
      <text>  10:31 AM CDT Sep 17, 2017 Trump advisers warn North Korea to give up weapons programs 
The warnings came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to continue the weapons programs   10:31 AM CDT Sep 17, 2017 DARLENE SUPERVILLE SOMERSET, N.J. — 
Top advisers to President Donald Trump on Sunday warned North Korea to give up its missile and nuclear weapons programs and to quit making threats against the U.S. and its allies or face destruction. 
The warnings came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to continue the weapons programs, saying his country is nearing its goal of &quot;equilibrium&quot; in military force with the United States. They also come as world leaders begin arriving in New York for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly this week, where the topic of North Korea will be high on the agenda. Advertisement 
Trump will be making his first appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, his biggest moment on the world stage since January&apos;s inauguration. He is scheduled to address the world body, which he has criticized as weak and incompetent, on Tuesday. 
Trump tweeted Sunday that he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed North Korea during their latest telephone conversation on Saturday. Trump spoke with Moon from his New Jersey golf club, where aides said he spent the weekend preparing for his U.N. debut. 
U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Kim is &quot;going to have to give up his nuclear weapons because the president has said he&apos;s not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon.&quot; 
Asked if that meant Trump would launch a military strike, McMaster said &quot;he&apos;s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.&quot; 
Kim has threatened Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, and has fired two missiles over Japan, a U.S. ally in Asia, including one missile that was launched on Friday. North Korea also recently tested its most powerful bomb. 
The U.N. Security Council has voted unanimously twice in recent weeks to tighten economic sanctions on North Korea, including targeting shipments of oil and other fuel used in missile testing. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said North Korea was starting to &quot;feel the pinch.&quot; 
But she also warned of a tougher U.S. response in the future, saying the Security Council has &quot;pretty much exhausted&quot; all of its options and that she would be happy to turn the matter over to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis &quot;because he has plenty of military options.&quot; 
Mattis said earlier this month, after Kim tested a hydrogen bomb, that the U.S. will answer any threat from the North with a &quot;massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming.&quot; 
Trump has threatened to rain &quot;fire and fury&quot; on North Korea. Haley said that wasn&apos;t an empty threat from the president but, when asked, she declined to describe the president&apos;s intentions. 
&quot;If North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed and we all know that and none of us want that,&quot; Haley said. &quot;None of us want war. But we also have to look at the fact that you are dealing with someone who is being reckless, irresponsible and is continuing to give threats not only to the United States, but to all their allies, so something is going to have to be done.&quot; 
In Sunday&apos;s tweet, Trump said he asked Moon about &quot;Rocket Man&quot; — an apparent reference to Kim. Trump also tweeted that long lines for gas are forming in North Korea and called it &quot;too bad.&quot; 
The White House said after Trump&apos;s tweet that he and Moon are committed to strengthening deterrence and defense capabilities, and maximizing economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea. 
Trump plans to sit down with Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the U.N. General Assembly session this week.</text>

      <text>Trump advisers warn North Korea to give up weapons programs By Darlene Superville Published September 17, 2017 White House Associated Press

SOMERSET, N.J. (AP) — Top advisers to President Donald Trump on Sunday warned North Korea to give up its missile and nuclear weapons programs and to quit making threats against the U.S. and its allies or face destruction.
The warnings came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vowed to continue the weapons programs, saying his country is nearing its goal of &quot;equilibrium&quot; in military force with the United States. They also come as world leaders begin arriving in New York for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly this week, where the topic of North Korea will be high on the agenda.
Trump will be making his first appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, his biggest moment on the world stage since January&apos;s inauguration. He is scheduled to address the world body, which he has criticized as weak and incompetent, on Tuesday.
Trump tweeted Sunday that he and South Korean President Moon Jae-in discussed North Korea during their latest telephone conversation on Saturday. Trump spoke with Moon from his New Jersey golf club, where aides said he spent the weekend preparing for his U.N. debut.
U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster said Kim is &quot;going to have to give up his nuclear weapons because the president has said he&apos;s not going to tolerate this regime threatening the United States and our citizens with a nuclear weapon.&quot;
Asked if that meant Trump would launch a military strike, McMaster said &quot;he&apos;s been very clear about that, that all options are on the table.&quot;
Kim has threatened Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, and has fired two missiles over Japan, a U.S. ally in Asia, including one missile that was launched on Friday. North Korea also recently tested its most powerful bomb.
More on this... North Korea is a global concern, Glenn Youngkin says Investors shake off latest North Korea missile test North Korea is a ‘menace’ that needs to be reigned in: John Snow The U.N. Security Council has voted unanimously twice in recent weeks to tighten economic sanctions on North Korea, including targeting shipments of oil and other fuel used in missile testing. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said North Korea was starting to &quot;feel the pinch.&quot;
But she also warned of a tougher U.S. response in the future, saying the Security Council has &quot;pretty much exhausted&quot; all of its options and that she would be happy to turn the matter over to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis &quot;because he has plenty of military options.&quot;
Mattis said earlier this month, after Kim tested a hydrogen bomb, that the U.S. will answer any threat from the North with a &quot;massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming.&quot;
Trump has threatened to rain &quot;fire and fury&quot; on North Korea. Haley said that wasn&apos;t an empty threat from the president but, when asked, she declined to describe the president&apos;s intentions.
&quot;If North Korea keeps on with this reckless behavior, if the United States has to defend itself or defend its allies in any way, North Korea will be destroyed and we all know that and none of us want that,&quot; Haley said. &quot;None of us want war. But we also have to look at the fact that you are dealing with someone who is being reckless, irresponsible and is continuing to give threats not only to the United States, but to all their allies, so something is going to have to be done.&quot;
In Sunday&apos;s tweet, Trump said he asked Moon about &quot;Rocket Man&quot; — an apparent reference to Kim. Trump also tweeted that long lines for gas are forming in North Korea and called it &quot;too bad.&quot;
The White House said after Trump&apos;s tweet that he and Moon are committed to strengthening deterrence and defense capabilities, and maximizing economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea.
Trump plans to sit down with Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during the U.N. General Assembly session this week.
Haley spoke on CNN&apos;s &quot;State of the Union&quot; and McMaster appeared on ABC&apos;s &quot;This Week.&quot;</text>

      <text>General H.R. McMaster on global threats; Blunt, Durbin talk DACA, dreamers and dealing with Trump Published September 17, 2017 This is a rush transcript from &quot;Fox News Sunday,&quot; September 17, 2017. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. CHRIS WALLACE, &quot;FOX NEWS SUNDAY&quot; HOST: I’m Chris Wallace. 
North Korea fires another missile while London is hit by a terror attack, as President Trump prepares to take the world stage and address the U.N. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
REX TILLERSON, U.S. STATE SECRETARY: North Korea is now a global threat and it requires a global response. 
LT. GEN. H.R. MCMASTER, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR: We&apos;ve been kicking the can down the road and we’re out of road. 
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: I have no problem kicking it to General Mattis because I think he has plenty of options. 
WALLACE (voice-over): We’ll discuss foreign hot spot and preview the president&apos;s message at the international community on North Korea, Iran and terror with national security advisor, General H.R. McMaster. 
Then, does President Trump have an immigration deal with Chuck and Nancy or not? 
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-NY, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: We have reached an understanding on this issue. We have to work out details. 
REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We have an agreement to move forward. 
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The wall to me is vital. If I don&apos;t get the wall, then we will become the obstruction. 
WALLACE: We’ll break down the DACA discussion and whether there&apos;s a new balance of power in Washington with two Senate leaders, Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Roy Blunt. 
Plus, big tech comes under fire. We’ll ask our Sunday panel about how Russia used Facebook in the 2016 election. 
And our power player of the week, breaking barriers while keeping some of the sports biggest stars in the game. 
(on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both Major League Baseball and the NFL? 
WALLACE (voice-over): All, right now, on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. 
The United Nations General Assembly has been called the super bowl of diplomacy. And this week, President Trump goes to New York to join other world leaders there for the first time. With plenty of hot spots to discuss, what will the president focus on and what action will he seek? 
Joining us live here in Washington, the president&apos;s national security advisor, General H.R. McMaster. 
General, welcome back to &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot; 
MCMASTER: Thanks, Chris, great to be here. 
WALLACE: As we say, President Trump speaks to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, his first time on that stage. How important does he think the speech is and how will he fit it into his appeal to world leaders into his doctrine of America First? 
MCMASTER: Well, he thinks the speech is a tremendous opportunity obviously to reach so many world leaders at the same time and to emphasize really three things. First is to protect the American people, the second is to promote American prosperity, and the third is really to help promote accountability and sovereignty. And in those three things will allow him to communicate his vision for America&apos;s role in the world, but also what his expectations are for international bodies like the United Nations, but also of other nations -- the expectation that they are up to protect the sovereignty of their citizens and respect the sovereignty of other nations. 
WALLACE: Well, let&apos;s unpack that and let&apos;s start with issue number one. And that, of course, is North Korea. The president tweeted about that this morning. Let&apos;s put it up on the screen. 
The president said: I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night, asked him -- excuse me -- asked him how Rocket Man is doing. Long gas lines forming in North Korea. Too bad. 
Well, before I get to the substance, Rocket Man, have you heard that from the president before or is that a new one? 
MCMASTER: Well, that&apos;s a new one and I think maybe for the president, but it reminds me of a cover of the &quot;Economist&quot; a few years ago, portraying him as Rocket Man. But, of course, that&apos;s where the rockets are coming from. Rockets, though, we ought to probably not laugh too much about because they do represent a great threat to all -- to everyone. 
WALLACE: All right. But let me -- 
MCMASTER: As Secretary Tillerson said at the outset, it is a global problem. 
WALLACE: Let&apos;s pick up on that, here&apos;s what you had to say on Friday. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
MCMASTER: We&apos;ve been kicking the can down the road and we’re out of road. And so, for those who have said, and have been commenting about the lack of a military option, there is a military option. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: General, what does that mean, out of road? The fact is you want to get sanctions more time. You’re not about to go to war. 
MCMASTER: Well, really, it really depends on how we see this threat continue to manifest itself and our judgment about how much time we have. We’re out of road because in the past, the approach taken to the problem of North Korea and the Kim regime over decades has been to enter into long, drawn out negotiations that then deliver an unsatisfactory agreement, an agreement that then the North Korean regime breaks. 
And what that agreement does, though, that’s particularly dangerous oftentimes, what has all the time in the past is locked in the status quo as the new normal. And this regime is so close now to threatening the United States and others with a nuclear weapon that we really have to move with a great deal of urgency on sanctions, on diplomacy, and on preparing, if necessary, a military option. 
WALLACE: So, how do you draw that line? How do you decide we&apos;ve reached the point that we have to move to a military option now? How long do you get sanctions? 
MCMASTER: Well, the president has asked all of us to work on this. So, we can&apos;t really talk about specific timelines or what conclusions we are coming to. 
But we are working very hard, very hard to make everything we are doing militarily, diplomatic -- diplomatically, economically, and with our allies and partners to be as effective as we can. And what we recognize is not really much time. 
WALLACE: All right. The administration -- I want to pick up on one part of that. The administration talks about getting tough with North Korea&apos;s trading partners. 
Here&apos;s Treasury Secretary Mnuchin this week. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
STEVEN MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: We will use economic sanctions to bring North Korea to the table. 
BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: You’re saying stopping trade with China? 
MNUCHIN: Stopping trade with anybody. Nobody would be off the table. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: But the U.S. did $648 billion of trade with China. They’re our single largest supplier for imported goods and our third largest market for export of goods. 
General, we’re not about to cut off trade with China. It would crater our economy. 
MCMASTER: Well, this is an indication, isn’t it, of how serious this problem is with North Korea, and why it&apos;s in all of our interest to work together to resolve it. So, of course, we China to help as much as they can. You know, they have a great deal of coercive economic power over North Korea. And, certainly, we think -- and the Chinese agree -- it&apos;s in their interest to have a denuclearized peninsula. 
WALLACE: But, I mean, let&apos;s be serious here. We’re not going to cut off all trade with China. 
MCMASTER: Well, they have to take some steps, though, that restrict trade in any way that we can with this regime, to choke off the resources that allowed this regime to continue to prioritize their military efforts, their missile efforts, their nuclear efforts over the well-being of their own people. 
WALLACE: Well, let me just pick up on that, that one point, isn&apos;t it possible -- in fact, isn&apos;t it likely -- that Kim has decided that the key to his survival is to have a nuclear capability? He talked this week about having equilibrium with the U.S. and that there&apos;s nothing that can be done diplomatically, nothing that can be done economically that will stop him from pursuing that effort. 
MCMASTER: Well, what he should conclude is the exactly opposite, that that continued pursuit of this nuclear capability makes him more and more vulnerable and makes him less and less secure. 
WALLACE: Let&apos;s turn to another subject. The president is also going to talk about getting tougher on Iran at the United Nations. But this week, he had the opportunity to re-impose sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal. He didn&apos;t do that. 
So, for all his talk about tearing up the agreement. I know he has to recertify in October whether or not they are complying with it, all this talk about tearing up the agreement, in fact, isn&apos;t he going to live with it and try to find other ways to confront Iran on other fronts? 
MCMASTER: Well, we have to see what live with it means, right? Live with can&apos;t be giving this regime cover to develop a nuclear capability. And so, a lot of things have to happen immediately, rigorous enforcement of that agreement. It is under-enforced now. We know Iran has already violated parts of the agreement by -- 
WALLACE: But the IAEA says that they’re complying with it, sir. 
MCMASTER: Well, the IAEA has identified and we&apos;ve identified some of these breaches that Iran has then corrected. But what does that tell you about Iranian behavior? They’re not just walking up to the line on the agreement. They’re crossing the line at times. 
So, there has to be much more rigorous enforcement of the deal and we have to recognize the fundamental flaws in this deal. It is -- as the president said -- it is the worst deal. It gave all these benefits to the Iranian regime upfront and these benefits now they are using to foment this humanitarian catastrophe in the greater Middle East. 
This broad range of destructive behavior, including support for terrorist organizations, like Hezbollah, support for proxy forces like 80 percent of the affected fighters fighting on the side of the brutal, murderous Assad regime in Syria are Iranian proxies. 
And so, we have to -- we have to recognize the broad range of Iranian destabilizing behavior and we can&apos;t allow this deal to enable that. Their missile programs, for example, the way they are seeding this Iranian network with more and more destructive capability that places all their neighbors at risk. 
WALLACE: I want to turn to that next subject which you brought up which is terror. The president is going to call at the U.N. for the world to continue its war on terror. Here&apos;s what he had to say this week. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: We have done better in eight months of my presidency than the previous eight years against ISIS. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: But, I don&apos;t have to tell you, a bomb went off in the London subway this week. That&apos;s the fifth terror attack in Great Britain just this year. And experts say, as we succeed, and we are succeeding, in pushing Iraq -- ISIS back in Iraq, shrinking its territory, it is only getting them to focus more on launching attacks in Europe and the U.S. 
MCMASTER: Well, the president has told us we have to do three fundamental things very effectively. 
The first is to ensure that these terrorists have no safe havens and support bases that allow them to organize, plan, and conduct attacks against us and against our allies. 
The second thing is we have to cut off the financing, the way that they resource these kinds of operations. 
And the third, we have to defeat their evil ideology. And this has a lot to do with some of Prime Minister May&apos;s top priorities, which is to constrict their ability to use the ability to communicate with each other. 
And then, of course, none of this is a substitute for important law enforcement actions across the world and improving even further our ability to share information and to gain visibility of these terrorist networks and defeat them. 
WALLACE: There is a report this weekend, I’m sure you read, that says that President Trump has decided he&apos;s not going to pull out of the Paris climate accord, that we may reduce our commitment to curb greenhouse gas emissions but he&apos;s going to live with the agreement, stay in the agreement with a reduced commitment. 
Is that true, sir? 
MCMASTER: No, it’s false. That&apos;s a false report. The president decided to pull out of the Paris Accord because it was a bad deal for the American people and because it was a bad deal for the environment. It gave the worst polluters the ability to continue polluting and emitting carbon without significantly reducing those levels. 
The president is committed to the cleanest water on Earth, the cleanest air on Earth, to an energy policy that reduces carbon emissions but then also provides clean fossil fuels to generate growth in this country and globally. And these priorities he felt we could not pursue effectively within this flawed agreement. 
WALLACE: So, he&apos;s out of the Paris Climate Accord? 
MCMASTER: He&apos;s out of the Paris Climate Accord. What he said, the door is open. If you look at what he said on the day that he announced withdrawing from the accord, he said, at some point in the future, if there can be, if there can be a ideal that addresses these some fundamental flaws -- 
(CROSSTALK) 
WALLACE: But the allies said they’re not going to renegotiate. 
MCMASTER: Well, the president&apos;s ears are open, though, if at some point they decide that they can come forward with an agreement that addresses the president&apos;s very legitimate concerns about Paris. 
WALLACE: OK. One final area. It&apos;s widely known in Washington that you and Steve Bannon have sharply different views of the world. One of the first things you did as national security advisor is kick him out as a regular official member of the NSC. 
He has dismissed you and some of the other advisors on the NSC as globalists. He has sharply disagreed with the decision to commit, to double down in Afghanistan. 
Question: is the administration better off with Steve Bannon out of the White House? 
MCMASTER: Well, the administration is better off when we can serve the president by integrating, coordinating across all of our departments and agencies with our key allies and partners and to present the president with multiple options. And then, based on his decisions, to help the president implement these policies that prioritize, protecting and advancing the interests of the American people. 
And so, what&apos;s important is to have an inclusive process, not to try to manipulate into a particular decision or to advance your own agenda. You know, we’re advancing the president&apos;s agenda and we are advancing policies and strategies that are for the American people. 
WALLACE: Well, you strike is a pretty straight talker. Are you saying that Steve Bannon was manipulating, that he was trying to work around and advance his own agenda? 
MCMASTER: Well, the National Security Council, I think, has served the president well in bringing him multiple options. There were some who try to operate outside of that process for their own narrow agendas, and that didn&apos;t serve the president well. 
WALLACE: That some people, does that include Steve Bannon, sir? 
MCMASTER: I think this has been too hyped on one individual. I mean, these reports of feuding, this really didn&apos;t even happen. I mean, we had our doors open to all perspectives within the National Security Council, and it was up to those individuals whether they would walk through that door and permit -- and participate in an open and transparent process. 
WALLACE: General McMaster, thank you. Thanks for your time. You’re a busy guy, we covered a lot of ground there in about 12 minutes. 
MCMASTER: It’s always a pleasure, Chris. Thank you. 
WALLACE: Thank you. And we’ll be watching the president&apos;s speech, of course, on Tuesday to the U.N., sir. 
MCMASTER: Thank you. 
WALLACE: Up next, we’ll talk with two leading senators about the president’s move to cut deals with Democrats. How long will it affect the Trump agenda and how long will it last? 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
WALLACE: President Trump had dinner with Democratic leaders Chuck and Nancy this week and they seem to have cooked up at least the outline of a deal on immigration that has many of the most devoted Trump supporters worried. So, where do we stand on DACA and who&apos;s driving the agenda now here in Washington? 
Joining us from Chicago, Dick Durbin, the Senate&apos;s number two Democrat. And here in Washington, Republican Senator Roy Blunt. 
Well, gentlemen, let’s start with the big question here in Washington. The most immediate question, does President Trump have a deal with speaker -- former Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer when it comes to DACA or not? 
And here’s part of what was a shifting conversation on Thursday. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: The wall is going to be built, and it will be funded a little bit later. 
SCHUMER: It was a very, very positive step for the president to commit to DACA protections without insisting on the inclusion of or even a debate about the border wall. 
TRUMP: They cannot obstruct the wall. The wall, to me, is vital. If I don&apos;t get the wall, then we will become the obstruction. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: Senator Durbin, I want to push on two specific points. Is there a deal to protect the DREAMers without funding for the wall? And is there a deal to give the DREAMers a path to citizenship? 
SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILL., SENATE MINORITY WHIP: Well, there&apos;s a basic understanding. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi met with the President Thursday night. They came to a basic understanding, without the details, without the obvious negotiations that have to follow. And then, Chuck and Nancy said to the president and the White House, we are going to put out a press release, so it&apos;s clear on both sides what we&apos;ve agreed to. They did exactly that. 
There was great pushback from the right. They didn&apos;t like the parameters of this understanding and there has been a lot of conversation since. But we are going forward. We are going forward with the understanding that we can work with the White House to come up with an agreement that includes DACA, that includes citizenship for those who are protected under the DREAM Act and also has a substantial commitment to increase border protection. Those are the two pillars of this understanding. 
WALLACE: And very briefly, in this understanding do you believe that the president committed to those pillars over Chinese food on Wednesday night? 
DURBIN: Yes. 
WALLACE: That&apos;s pretty brief. 
OK. Senator Blunt, the president seemed to walk away from at least the citizenship part of this deal later on Thursday. Let&apos;s take a look at that. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: We’re not talking about amnesty at all. We have not talked about amnesty. There will be no amnesty. We’re not talking about that as part of the transaction. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: So, Senator, helpless clear this up, because -- I mean, there&apos;s genuine confusion here in Washington. Do you believe that there is a deal on these issues and is this something that Republican senators could support? 
SEN. ROY BLUNT, R-MISSOURI: Well, I think there&apos;s a desire to come to a conclusion here on both sides and Senator Durbin just mentioned border security as part of the understanding, but the details haven&apos;t been worked out, another thing that he mentioned. 
Well, the details here matter. You know, it&apos;s always been three separate questions in my view. One is, how do you secure the border? Two is, what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country? And three, what you do with people who came or stayed, or in the case of the Dreamers, were brought to the country illegally? 
I think it would be very shortsighted not to try to do all we can to solve the first problem, and the president has unbelievable credibility here. If you solve the first problem, the other problems I think are reasonably solvable, we are seeing that to happen as people want to come together and deal with the issue who of kids who were brought here illegally. 
But you’re not going to be able to solve this problem in a satisfactory way unless you give the present at the leeway he needs to be able to some point in the future say the border is now operationally secure. That allows everybody to move to solve these other problems in a better way, Chris. 
WALLACE: But, again, briefly, and I hope you will be as brief as Senator Durbin is, giving them leeway to secure the border, does that have to include funding for the wall, specifically funding for the wall as opposed to other measures, and secondly, citizenship for Dreamers? 
BLUNT: It appears it would -- it would not preclude the wall, but it doesn&apos;t have to include the wall at this point I don&apos;t think. There are a lots of things have to happen to secure the border and should -- in terms of citizenship, does that mean you wouldn&apos;t have to take the test that everybody else takes? How long would you have to be here under the DREAM Act (ph)? There are lots of things that can and will be worked out there. 
WALLACE: All right. Let&apos;s turn to the bigger issue, which is whether or not President Trump is forming a new alliance with congressional Democrats at the expense of Republicans. Here is what the president had to say about that on Air Force One. 
(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) 
TRUMP: If the Republicans don&apos;t stick together then I’m going to have to do more work. If they are unable to stick together, then I’m going to have to get a little help from the Democrats and I’ve got that, I’ll tell you. 
(END AUDIO CLIP) 
WALLACE: Senator Blunt, given the failure of Senate Republicans to pass Obamacare repeal and replace, isn&apos;t it wise for this president to go to Democrats and look for some votes? 
BLUNT: Well, I think the minority can&apos;t abuse the rules of the Senate. But under the rules of the Senate, you have to have some Democrats work with you to get most things done. The tenures -- I was either the chief deputy whip for the deputy whip in the House, we passed two bills in 10 years that didn’t have Democrats vote for them. That&apos;s part of the work -- that’s how you get the work done here in a way that allows everything else to move forward. 
So, looking for Democrats on every bill is a good idea, but making it impossible to get your work done because you’ve lost your own side is not part of that either. 
WALLACE: Senator Durbin, do you think that there is the potential for a real -- not permanent, but working alliance between President Trump and congressional Democrats? And what you say to those members -- folks on the left who don&apos;t trust this president and don&apos;t trust making deals with him? 
DURBIN: Well, of course, there will be people on the right and left who will be critical. But Senator Roy Blunt and I are good examples of how this can work. I have joined him and applauded his leadership in dramatically increasing biomedical research in the United States on a bipartisan basis. Lamar Alexander, Patty Murray joined us. 
Two weeks ago, Schumer and Pelosi sat down with the president and the other leaders and said, we can help you move immediately for Hurricane Harvey assistance, to have a short-term spending bill so the government doesn&apos;t shut down and to extend the debt ceiling of the United States, we’ll do it on a bipartisan basis, Mr. President. That&apos;s what American wants. And the president said, I’ll take it. 
We did it. And we can do more like that, as long as we trust one another, respect the differences that we obviously do have, but try to work toward a goal. Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander have accomplished more in the last two weeks of strengthening our health care system and moving forward to make the Affordable Care Act more affordable and more transparent than we achieved in seven months of partisan wrangling on the floor of the Senate. It can be done. 
WALLACE: But there are some differences. I mean, you talked for instance about NIH spending, the Trump administration wants to cut NIH spending. 
And let me talk about another big difference on the hot issue of tax reform. The president wants to slash corporate taxes and end the estate tax, Democrats opposed both. The president talks about paying for tax cuts based on assumptions of dramatic growth, Democrats reject that. 
Senator Durbin, is there a deal given those very sharp differences, fundamental differences, is there a deal to be made on tax reform? 
DURBIN: Chris, there will be differences, but that&apos;s what the Senate is all about -- sitting down with Democrats and Republicans and the Republicans are in the majority, and really working out an amendment process that comes to a conclusion where both sides have to compromise to some degree. That&apos;s where you get the best legislation and that&apos;s where you get something the American people can trust. 
Jamming something through on one side or the other is just not the way to achieve it. We proved that with repeal and replace. That did not achieve what America wanted, a stronger health care system with more people with insurance coverage and quality insurance policies they can trust. 
WALLACE: Senator Blunt, what are the implications of all this for the 2018 midterm elections? You have the president out on the stump recently with North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp. This is somebody who was a vulnerable Democrat, one of the prime targets for Republicans to knock her off in 2018. The president is saying nice things about her. 
When you add that to the president appearing to compromise on some of his basic campaign pledges, couldn&apos;t this hurt Republicans in 2018? 
BLUNT: Well, on the tax front, it’s very important we get something done -- increases take-home pay for working families, that we’re almost into a decade now of very flat opportunities for families with their take-home pay. A tax bill that increases take-home pay, and in the future creates better jobs with more take-home pay, with more pay to start with is where we should be headed. 
We ought to be looking for anybody who wants to be part of that. But, you know, 46 Democrats sent a letter to the president that said, we’d be glad to work with you as long as you don&apos;t do these three things that you think are important parts of the tax package. That&apos;s not a good way to start. 
WALLACE: Finally, Senator Blunt -- and I got about a minute left -- there was more violent protest in St. Louis overnight. People angry about the acquittal of a white police officer who was charged with murder in the death of a drug -- black drug suspect. I know everyone opposes the violence, but even the mayor of St. Louis said she was appalled by the shooting and appalled by the verdict. 
So, what’s your reaction to the situation there and the clear anger of a lot of people in the African-American community? 
BLUNT: Well, I talked yesterday to the police chiefs that are involved in what the chiefs are doing. I also talked to a number of community leaders and African-American pastors. I do think this is a place where we have to figure out how to come together. You do have to accept what the judge who has the obligation to look at this case determined. 
But at the same time, you have to look at what we need to do to bring the community together in ways that both law enforcement and community leaders have been trying to do, particularly since Ferguson. This happened before that happened. And we just need to continue to watch this. 
The division in the country whether it&apos;s St. Louis or Baltimore is not a good thing and we all need to be working hard to make our system work. 
WALLACE: Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, thank you both. We’ll stay on top of how all of this work between the president and Chuck and Nancy plays out in Congress. Thank you all, gentlemen. 
Coming up, we’ll bring in our Sunday group to discuss President Trump&apos;s new search for votes on both sides of the aisle. 
Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the president&apos;s potential deal to protect Dreamers without getting funding for the border wall? 
Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump reaching across the aisle on tax reform, suggesting there may be no cuts for the rich. 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
TRUMP: I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are -- pretty much where they are. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: We’ll ask our send a panel about the prospect for passing tax reform. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
SCHUMER: He likes us. He likes me anyway. 
I said, Mr. President, you&apos;re much better off if you can sometimes step right and sometimes step left. If you have to step just in one direction you&apos;re boxed. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer caught on a hot mic on the Senate floor describing his advice to President Trump to deal with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. 
And it&apos;s time now for our Sunday group. Former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Rachael Bade, who covers Congress for Politico, Julie Pace, Washington bureau chief for the Associated Press, and Guy Benson of townhall.com. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, you worked with Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s as he wasn&apos;t doing what was called triangulation, trying to negotiate apart from both Republicans and his own Democratic Party. Is that what President Trump is doing here, and will it work? 
NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I think Trump is a better dealmaker. I think that&apos;s -- he wants things to work. He wants to get the job done. I think the other day he was faced with two visits to Houston, terrible devastation, a hurricane coming to Florida, and he had the usual partisan infighting for two or three weeks or take a deal. 
And he took a deal. And it worked. And I think he thought, well, maybe we&apos;ll do a little more. 
Now, the challenge will be that the goals of Schumer and Pelosi and their base are so radically different from Trump that the margins for deals may be smaller than people would like. But I think it&apos;s perfectly reasonable. I -- look, I advocated for months that they start with infrastructure because it was inherently bipartisan. And I think that presidents govern best when they carve a large block out of the opposition party and have a -- and have a much bigger majority than just their own partisan base. 
WALLACE: Julie, what are they saying -- you cover the White House -- what are they staying at the White House. How frustrated are they with Republican leaders and particularly their inability to deliver on Obamacare repeal and replace? And how much hope to they hold given that, as I said, on a lot of the -- and the speakers said on a lot of the basic issues what they want in tax reform, what they want in immigration, that there&apos;s such big differences -- how much hope do they hold for a working alliance with the Democrats? 
JULIE PACE, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Well, I think you have to put this in context of the relationship that the president has with McConnell and Ryan. With McConnell in particular, there&apos;s just not much of a relationship there. So when you come out of something like the Obamacare debates and the president sees that McConnell just can&apos;t get it over the finish line, there&apos;s not a lot of personal bonding there to keep that going. So there was a lot of frustration in the White House after that specific debate on the Capitol. 
And I think when the president looks at Schumer, more so than Pelosi, but Schumer in particular, you know, he sees someone he likes. And this is a president who like the personal relationship. He likes to have a bond with someone. Yes, there are going to be differences on the policies, yes, they are not going to be aligned on everything. But where he can make an agreement, I think he is perfectly fine. And he&apos;s been hearing from people like Speaker Gingrich and others around him for months that this is actually what he should do, that this is an advantage for someone like Trump, who isn&apos;t particularly ideological, who doesn&apos;t have deep roots to the conservative movement or Republican ideology. 
WALLACE: So -- so when it comes to DACA, does not mean the wall? Well, maybe not. Citizenship? Maybe yes. 
PACE: I think on the wall, I mean this is something that you&apos;ve seen the president multiple times when he&apos;s had a chance to go to the mat over the wall and say, I&apos;m going to hold up a certain piece of legislation, I&apos;m going to veto it over this wall. He&apos;s backed off. And I think that for his base, that&apos;s going to continue to be a frustration, but he&apos;s certainly shown a willingness to punt that, kick it down the road a little bit. 
WALLACE: We asked you for question for the panel. And on this issue of the president making a deal with Democrats on DACA, there was a lot of confusion from you, as there has been here in Washington. Let&apos;s put some of it up. 
Fox Mulder -- I love that -- tweeted this, does Trump even want to get funding for the wall? Build that wall got him elected. How else will he rally his base? 
And Rick Conner posted this on Facebook, how do you think amnesty for these illegals will square with the president&apos;s campaign promises to the contrary? Is this just a negotiating ploy to get his agenda through, wall and all? 
Guy, how do you answer them? 
GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: That&apos;s what everyone is trying to figure out in this town, including, I think, both senators that you just interviewed a little while ago. You know, I went back and tried to figure out maybe what would a deal start to look like on DACA? What would the contours perhaps start to come together with? And I think the wall seems to be out, at least for this particular piece. He says maybe sometime in the future. Unclear. 
But it seems like ancient history at this point. But 2013 there was the gang of eight bill that eventually was killed in the House. But Democrats agreed in principle to a whole swath of border security and immigration enforcement provisions that I think would probably form the basis for something where Trump could potentially, somewhat credibly, claim a victory. And I went back and I looked at some of those provisions, $40 billion for border security, 20,000 new security agents, 700 miles of fencing. That&apos;s a physical border. That was in gang of eight, agreed to in the so-called &quot;border surge.&quot; So there&apos;s a chance that while the wall might be part of a DACA deal, there could be something that could be spun as or framed as a wall or a physical barrier. 
WALLACE: And how do you think -- I mean it&apos;s crazy to ask you what&apos;s the base going to do, but I&apos;m going to ask you, what do you think the reaction of the real Trump hardliners, the real base will be if they get a deal on DACA that includes citizenship and doesn&apos;t include a wall as it had been commonly thought to exist? 
BENSON: Well, last week I had a long car ride, so I listen to talk radio for about six hours straight, and it was really interesting. They opened the phone lines and it was Trump base voters calling in. And there was some trepidation, there was some concern about where this might go. But, overall, there was a sense that they trust President Trump, that they think that he&apos;s three steps ahead of anyone else and that ultimately he&apos;s got their interests at heart. And that was sort of reflected across-the-board for most of his supporters. So that&apos;s what I would guess would be the case, unless it is egregiously bad. 
WALLACE: Rachael, from your post covering Capitol Hill, what do you think is the -- are the prospects for a deal that can be passed on DACA and the prospects for a deal on tax reform? 
RACHAEL BADE, POLITICO: You talk to Republicans right now, they would tell you, a slim chance in terms of the White House striking a deal with Democrats and getting it over the line, while cutting out GOP leadership. You know, you mentioned that a lot of the base still has faith in Trump and they see this. They say he knows our interests, he&apos;s going to do what is best for us. 
There&apos;s a totally different feeling on Capitol Hill with GOP leadership. I heard a lot of frustration and questioning of, what is this strategy? What is the end game here? Basically, you know, Republicans control both houses of Congress. You know, so cutting out leadership is not the smartest thing for the president at this point in time, at least Republicans will tell you that. 
For instance, take the DACA deal. I was talking to some folks in leadership who were saying that they don&apos;t understand why he took the wall off the table to begin with. It&apos;s the number one bargaining chip, they said, in terms of negotiating a deal. If you&apos;re going to take it off the table with Democrats, you should get something for it. So they&apos;re going to try to push him to put that back on the table and sort of use that to get a deal that is possible that conservatives could vote for it. 
WALLACE: And what about tax reform? This is -- I pointed out with the two senators, they&apos;re so different on tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy, on whether or not it&apos;s going to add to the deficit or not, unless you put in what they called dynamic scoring and include a lot of the growth that is a guess whether or not it&apos;s going to happen. 
BADE: Yes, I don&apos;t mean to sound alarmist, but tax reform is also in trouble right now. And it -- again, it goes back to this sort of shift we&apos;re seeing in the president going from just working to Republicans, to now wanting to work with Democrats. For instance, Republicans on The Hill, Speaker Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Gary Cohn, they&apos;ve all been writing a Republican bill and they&apos;re about to unveil it. 
Last week we saw the president come out and float the idea of increasing taxes on the wealthy, which blows in the face of sly-side economics and goes against -- 100 percent against what Republicans would want to see in a tax bill. So there&apos;s a fear that he&apos;s overstepping right now in terms of reaching out to Democrats and they&apos;re concerned that this is going to undercut them. And not only a Republican base, but the president and what he wants to do. 
WALLACE: A quick reactions, speaker? 
GINGRICH: I think the most interesting side story was Democrats won this big agreement. Everything was going to end in December. The Democrats are going to have this huge leverage because the debt ceiling ended in December. A few days later, Mitch McConnell pointed out that as the majority leader he controlled the paper. And they took out the provisions Schumer most wanted. And -- 
WALLACE: Which was about extraordinary measures, which means that they can keep the debt ceiling going till March. 
GINGRICH: February or March. And he said, you know, I happen to be the majority leader and I control the paper and we did it on my way (ph). And Schumer, faced with that reality, couldn&apos;t break -- he couldn&apos;t say no. So we&apos;re a long way -- this dance is going to continue for a while. I think the Democrats face the real risk. Do they really hate the wall more than they love the dreamers? Because if I were the president, that&apos;s the way I&apos;d drive it. I&apos;d say these people are so ideological they&apos;d rather sacrifice the dreamers. 
WALLACE: All right. Gridlock breaking out here in Washington. 
All right, panel, we have to take a break here. 
When we combat, with growing tension between Washington and Silicon Valley, powerful Internet companies face talk of more government oversight. We&apos;ll bring back the panel to discuss Congress&apos; new scrutiny of big tech. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
MARK WARNER, D-VIRGINIA SENATOR: I think that we&apos;re still at the tip of the iceberg. The fact is, I don&apos;t think FaceBook has put the resources, the time. My understanding is they didn&apos;t even go back and check all those accounts to see if they had put out -- put out other ads. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
WALLACE: Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia after Facebook admitted it sold $150,000 worth of ads in the 2016 election to groups linked to Russia, spurring investigations by both congressional committees and Special Counsel Robert Mueller. 
And we&apos;re back now with the panel. 
Speaker Gingrich, how big a development is this and are we beginning to see the end of Washington&apos;s hands-off approach to big tech and especially these huge Internet companies? 
GINGRICH: Yes, look, I think this is probably four to six years behind the curve. These companies are so big, they control so much of our lives, they can set so many different policies internally with no supervision, that having not just the Russian angle, but really looking at the underlying nature of these companies, what they do, how they make decisions, these are the equivalent of gigantic public utilities. And in the information age, they have enormous power. And I don&apos;t think you, in a free society, you can&apos;t have power that&apos;s hidden away in secret, controlled by a handful of billionaires. 
WALLACE: Well, one of the things that Mark Warner, who was a tech guy himself before he went into politics, said, that it&apos;s the wild, wild west there. Now, some people would say that&apos;s one of the reasons it succeed. Are you saying put government clamps on it? 
GINGRICH: No, look, I think having the wild, wild west when companies are small is exactly right. Several of these companies are so enormous that there&apos;s some sense of, what does it mean to us as a free society to have global corporations run by founding billionaires who are -- have been, in effect, totally out of control and who internally can wipe out a company and wipe -- I mean they can be anti-conservative, they can be anti-liberal, they can do all sorts of things, and there&apos;s been almost no supervision, just to surface (ph) the information. 
WALLACE: President -- Rachael, President Obama and Democrats, I think you&apos;d agree, generally had a pretty cozy relationship with the big Internet companies, like Facebook, like Google, like Amazon. Is that changing on Capitol Hill now, as the speaker suggested it should, and is there a partisan divide in how Republicans and Democrats see these Internet behemoths? 
BADE: Yes, absolutely. The days of the industry sort of basking in the sunless praise from Washington are basically coming to an end right now. Look, for a long time Congress had sort of a light touch with the tech industry, but now you have Democrats who are furious about these Russia-linked ads that ran in 2016. Republicans are worried that Google is oppressing conservative voices. Both sides are concerned about people&apos;s private information being gathered and what happens if they&apos;re hacked. And so those are all concerns. 
So, yes, generally, Republicans control everything right now in Washington and they&apos;re typically anti-regulation. But it&apos;s safe to say that this sort of darling industry is now becoming a target as much as anything else. 
WALLACE: And do you have any thought about how you do it when the rubber hits the road? How do you allow these companies to grow and prosper but with some guardrails? 
BADE: I think that&apos;s the question that The Hill is sort of grappling with right now, how do they do this but allow an industry to continue to grow, that influences everyone&apos;s life so much? Look, there&apos;s a test case that&apos;s going on right now on Capitol Hill. There&apos;s going to be some hearings coming up in the Senate this week to examine whether big websites and tech companies can be held liable for child sex trafficking on the Internet. Right now they cannot be sued if a user were to put illicit content on the Internet. 
So the Senate is going to look at re-examining this. The tech industry is putting a lot of money in K Street to lobby against this. But I think this is an interesting first test, right? Like if -- if they can&apos;t -- if they&apos;re not going to see something as heinous as child sex trafficking as a reason to regulate, then it&apos;s safe to say that big tech still has a lot of power. 
WALLACE: It&apos;s funny you talk about K Street. It is amazing. Which is the big center of lobbying here in Washington. And there was a chart in The Wall Street Journal that show the lobbying expenditures by these companies has just skyrocketed in the last few years. 
Julie, where are President Trump and his administration on this? You talk about utilities, Speaker Gingrich. Steve Bannon used to talk about treating Facebook and Google as public utilities, which meant heavy regulation. 
PACE: Right. Steve Bannon, of course, now outside the White House. So, look, the -- at least rhetorically the position of this White House, when it comes to big tech, is so different from the Obama administration, which really wrapped its arms around the Googles and Amazon&apos;s and Facebooks and presented them as examples of American companies that are -- that are growing strong and are dominating on the global stage. 
Trump, I think, has been turned off a bit by the fact that some of the leaders of these companies are not particularly pleased with his administration and have spoken out on a lot of issues. I don&apos;t think you can divorce this conversation when it comes to the White House from that. But he&apos;s also taken on Amazon, and not just for Jeff Bezos&apos;s role in owning The Washington Post, he&apos;s taken on Amazon on his Twitter account. 
I think that you are seeing some of this stemming from the president&apos;s populist message in general as well. I mean he looks at Wall Street and some of the big firms there and I think looks at tech in somewhat of the same way, a massive company that can get out of control. And he -- when he looks at his base, he can see their frustration with that. The frustration of small business owners who see themselves getting taken over by a giant like Amazon. 
WALLACE: Yes. There&apos;s also this whole question, before I get to you, Guy, about the fact that Internet companies, when they have sales, they don&apos;t have to pay taxes, but the mom and pop store in the town on Main Street does have to pay taxes. 
PACE: And that&apos;s when you&apos;ve see him go after Amazon in particular for. He&apos;s done this in a -- in a series of tweets. I think it will be interesting to see if this comes up in the discussion on The Hill on tax reform if we are -- do end up talking about a big tax reform package. 
WALLACE: That would actually add a lot of revenue, wouldn&apos;t it? 
PACE: Yes (ph). 
WALLACE: That would really -- that would get the lobbyists -- because, Guy, there&apos;s another aspect of all of this that I want to get to, and that&apos;s growing questions about the culture in Silicon Valley. 
You had three former female employees of Google just file what they hope will be a class action lawsuit charging them with pay and promotion discrimination. And as you know, there have been a number of complaints and lawsuits alleging sexual harassment in these companies. So that wild, wild west attitude applies also to the culture in Silicon Valley. 
BENSON: That&apos;s right. So you&apos;ll have Democrats, in particular I think, focusing on those problems and equal pay and is there discrimination in Silicon Valley. And then you&apos;ll have on the other side, as Rachael alluded to, a lot of conservatives and Republicans look at what happened at Mozilla a few years ago and Brendan Eich ousted from that company for having traditional views on marriage. And then the firing of that engineer of Google. 
Is there rampant discrimination in terms of viewpoints against conservatives and how might that play out in terms of average users having information potentially stifled in searches? There are real concerns about that on the right. So, big tech might be waking up these days and saying, uh-oh, we have real problems culturally on the left and the right in this country and that could be a problem for us on Capitol Hill as lawmakers on both sides, rather, start to dig in. 
WALLACE: But I want to pick up on something that I asked Speaker Gingrich, because there&apos;s no question that these companies have been engines of huge economic growth in this country. Is there a downside to Washington -- obviously there&apos;s a downside. How big a downside is there to Washington getting more involved in regulation of the Internet? 
BENSON: A huge downside. I think some of the concerns that the speaker raised are fair and reasonable and people would agree with them. My faith in the ability of government to respond to that wealth to regulation is very low. I think it is -- government is slow-moving. It is the opposite of innovative. And the Internet is a miracle. And it wouldn&apos;t exist as it does today if the government&apos;s clumsy hand had been on its neck from day one. And I think putting more hand on the neck and applying more pressure from D.C., I&apos;m just not sure that works out well. 
WALLACE: Fifteen seconds to respond, speaker. 
GINGRICH: First of all, the Internet was created by ARPANET, a Department of Defense project. Second, the fact is, there are no time in American history when the huge concentrations of power are not directly challenged by government. And that&apos;s overall been good for protecting our liberty. 
WALLACE: All right. We&apos;ll continue this debate. 
This is an important subject and we&apos;ll keep talking about it. 
Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. 
Up next, our &quot;Power Player of the Week.&quot; The doctor who keeps both the Washington Redskins and Nationals healthy, while breaking down barriers in pro sports. 
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
WALLACE: The pro football season is now in full swing. And as we fans dream of how our team will get to the Super Bowl, we know injuries have a way of derailing those hopes, which brings us to our &quot;Power Player of the Week.&quot; 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
DR. ROBIN WEST, HEAD PHYSICIAN, WASHINGTON REDSKINS: In sports medicine, people are very highly motivated so they can play to get better. 
WALLACE: Orthopedic surgeon Robin West has a busy schedule. Most of the time she&apos;s the head of Inova Sports Medicine in Virginia, except when she&apos;s the lead position for both the Washington Redskins and the Washington Nationals. 
WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you to be the first female head doctor in the history of both major league baseball and the NFL? 
WEST: I don&apos;t even think about it. I never -- it never really crossed my mind. I -- I never think of myself as different. 
WALLACE (voice-over): We saw for ourselves at a Skins exhibition game. Nose tackle Phil Taylor went down on a play and West ran on the field. She examined him there and back on the sidelines for what turned out to be a season ending tear of his left quadriceps muscle. 
West told us how different injuries are in the two sports. 
WEST: It&apos;s over use typically in baseball. We&apos;re dealing with a lot of shoulder and elbow injuries in baseball. In football, it&apos;s a lot of traumatic injuries, high-energy injuries that we have to really manage quickly. 
WALLACE: That&apos;s another difference. In baseball, an injured player is out of the game. But in football -- 
WEST: The coaches are in my ear as I&apos;m examining the kid, is he going to play, is he going to play? I have to decide that pretty quickly. 
WALLACE: But West emphasizes how she makes that decision. 
WEST: I&apos;m the players&apos; doctor, right? So it&apos;s -- I want the best for the player. So, obviously, I work for the -- I don&apos;t work for the team, I -- I want the team to do well, but I have to look at the players&apos; best interests. 
WALLACE (on camera): Is being a woman an advantage or a disadvantage to doing your job? 
WEST: At least in football, a lot of them were raised by their mothers and their grandmothers and so they have -- they hold women in a very high regard and they come to me and will tell me more information and I -- they are very trusting, I think. 
WALLACE (voice-over): Dr. West usually does any reconstructive surgeries, but she says psychological outlook is key to getting players back on the field. 
WEST: One of my players today, who I operated on last week, he said he&apos;s a mental fortress. But yet I have another player who&apos;s coming to me and saying, I&apos;m just -- I&apos;m so depressed. I&apos;m not around my team. I -- and they&apos;re coming to me and they&apos;re asking me for help on the mental side. 
WALLACE: Growing up, West was interested in the human body. Her mom noticed. 
WEST: When I was five, she got me a &quot;Gray&apos;s Anatomy&quot; book for Christmas. 
WALLACE (on camera): Why? 
WEST: That was my present. I don&apos;t know. I just was fascinated by it. 
WALLACE: Now the big concern is brain injuries, but she says the NFL has developed a much stricter policy on concussions. 
WEST: I think football&apos;s the safest it&apos;s ever been. 
WALLACE: Before Washington, West was an assistant team doctor for the Pittsburgh Steelers and got two Super Bowl rings. Her dream now, to win championships in both football and baseball. 
WEST: That&apos;s our goal, right? That&apos;s everyone&apos;s goal on the team is to keep the players healthy and to be as successful as we can. It&apos;s a pentacle, and you can&apos;t get any better than that. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
WALLACE: Dr. West says the Redskins have 15 medical professionals at each game on the field and up in the stands watching to see if any player gets hurt and relaying that information to her. 
And that&apos;s it for today. Have a great week. And we&apos;ll see you next &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;

      <title>5 Fall TV Trends: Recycling, superheroes, true crime, and more (video) - OregonLive.com</title>
      <text>5 Fall TV Trends: Recycling, superheroes, true crime, and more (video) Comment Updated on September 16, 2017 at 4:08 PM Posted on September 16, 2017 at 4:03 PM Debra Messing as Grace Adler, and Eric McCormack as Will Truman in the return of &quot;Will &amp; Grace.&quot; Debra Messing as Grace Adler, and Eric McCormack as Will Truman in the return of &quot;Will &amp; Grace.&quot; ( Chris Haston/NBC By Kristi Turnquist The Oregonian/OregonLive 
There are dozens of new shows that will premiere during the 2017 Fall TV season, and while there&apos;s some variety among the newcomers, five trends stand out. Such series as the &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; revival, &quot;SEAL Team,&quot; &quot;Law &amp; Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders,&quot; and others are examples of TV&apos;s habit of following the herd. 
Here are the five trends that stand out in the Fall TV season: 
1. Superheroes: Following in the inspired-by-comics footsteps of such series as &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;The Flash&quot; on The CW and &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Luke Cage&quot; on Netflix, TV is all over the superhero fad. Examples this fall include &quot;The Gifted,&quot; on Fox (premiering Oct. 2) about children who have mutant powers; &quot;Marvel&apos;s Inhumans,&quot; on ABC (Sept. 29) about beings with special powers; and &quot;Marvel&apos;s Runaways&quot; (Nov. 21), on Hulu, about teens who discover their parents aren&apos;t just annoying, they&apos;re villains. 
2. TV recycling: This one apparently ever gets old, for the networks, at least. &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (Sept. 28) is coming back to NBC with the original cast. The old cop show &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (Nov. 2) gets a new cast, and a gritty feel. &quot;Dynasty&quot; (Oct. 11) bubbles up more soap on The CW. And soon to come in 2018 will be a sequel to &quot;Roseanne,&quot; and another miniseries of &quot;The X-Files&quot; episodes. 
3. Military shows: Get ready to see actors trying to act macho -- male and female alike -- as the mini-trend of series about noble warriors risking their lives to protect us invade the airwaves. Examples are CBS&apos; &quot;SEAL Team&quot; (Sept. 27), NBC&apos;s &quot;The Brave&quot; (Sept. 25) and The CW&apos;s &quot;Valor&quot; (Oct. 9.) 
4. Political humor: Here&apos;s a trend that already took off in 2016, during the presidential campaign between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and has only kept going, with Alec Baldwin&apos;s Trump impression and Melissa McCarthy&apos;s Sean Spicer parody generating &quot;Saturday Night Live Buzz,&quot; and late-night comedy/talk shows specializing in skewering the political scene. The new entry is &quot;The Opposition With Jordan Klemmer,&quot; which will follow &quot;The Daily Show With Trevor Noah&quot; on Comedy Central beginning Sept. 25. 
5. True crime: The trend that picked up speed with the Netflix docuseries &quot;Making a Murderer&quot; keeps going. In addition to documentaries on cable and broadcast exploring real-life crime cases, this fall brings &quot;Law &amp; Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders,&quot; based on the infamous homicide case. Edie Falco stars in the limited series, which premieres Sept. 26 on NBC.

      <title>Top US diplomat says closing Embassy in Cuba &apos;under review&apos;</title>
      <text>Top US diplomat says closing embassy in Cuba &apos;under review&apos; The Canadian Press Published September 17, 2017 - 9:05pm Last Updated September 17, 2017 - 9:10pm 
NEW YORK — The Trump administration is considering closing down the recently reopened U.S. Embassy in Havana following a string of unexplained incidents harming the health of American diplomats in Cuba, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday. 
Tillerson&apos;s comments were the strongest indication to date that the United States might mount a major diplomatic response, potentially jeopardizing the historic restart of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The two former foes reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015 after a half-century of estrangement. 
&quot;We have it under evaluation,&quot; Tillerson said of a possible embassy closure. &quot;It&apos;s a very serious issue with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered. We&apos;ve brought some of those people home. It&apos;s under review.&quot; 
Of the 21 medically confirmed U.S. victims — diplomats and their families — some have permanent hearing loss or concussions, while others suffered nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. Some are struggling with concentration or common word recall, The Associated Press has reported . 
Some victims felt vibrations or heard loud sounds mysteriously audible in only parts of rooms, leading investigators to consider a potential &quot;sonic attack.&quot; Others heard nothing but later developed symptoms. 
Tillerson once called the events &quot;health attacks,&quot; but the State Department has since used the term &quot;incidents&quot; while emphasizing the U.S. still doesn&apos;t know what has occurred. Cuba has denied any involvement or responsibility but stressed it&apos;s eager to help the U.S. resolve the matter. 
The U.S. has said the tally of Americans affected could grow as more cases are potentially detected. 
The last reported incident was on Aug. 21, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter. The official wasn&apos;t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and requested anonymity. 
A decision to shutter the embassy, even temporarily, would deal a demoralizing blow to the delicate detente that President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raul Castro announced in late 2014. The next year, embassies were reopened and restrictions on travel and commerce eased — signs of a warming relationship that displeased some hard-liners in Cuba&apos;s government. President Donald Trump has reversed some of the changes, but left many in place. 
Tillerson spoke on CBS&apos; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; as world leaders and top diplomats descended on New York for annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. President Donald Trump will give his first speech on the major global platform this week. 
Cuba is also represented at the U.N., but it&apos;s not expected Trump will meet with any Cuban leaders or officials during his visit. 
The U.S. hasn&apos;t identified either a culprit or a device. Investigators have explored the possibility of sonic waves, an electromagnetic weapon, or an advanced spying operation gone awry, U.S. officials briefed on the probe told the AP. The U.S. hasn&apos;t ruled out that a third country or a rogue faction of Cuba&apos;s security services might be involved. 
In Washington, lawmakers in Congress have been raising alarm over the incidents, with some calling for the embassy to be closed. On Friday, five Republican senators wrote Tillerson urging him to not only shutter the embassy, but also kick all Cuban diplomats out of the United States — a move with dramatic diplomatic implications 
&quot;Cuba&apos;s neglect of its duty to protect our diplomats and their families cannot go unchallenged,&quot; said the lawmakers, who included Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who led the effort, and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a prominent Cuban-American and critic of the U.S. detente. 
The incidents have frightened Havana&apos;s tight-knit diplomatic community, raising concerns about the potential scope. At least one other country, France, has tested embassy staff for potential sonic-induced injuries, the AP has reported.
