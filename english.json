      "text": "By Mark DeCambre and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatch\nConsumer-price index shows a rise of 0.4%, compared with economist estimates for a 0.3% increase\nU.S. stock benchmarks traded modestly lower on Thursday following data on jobless claims and inflation. The Dow industrials, however, carved out a fresh all-time high, highlighting a record trend for Wall Street equities.\nThe consumer-price index rose 0.4% (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/higher-rents-gas-boost-inflation-in-august-cpi-shows-2017-09-14) in August, beating consensus estimates for a gain of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-weekly-jobless-claims-drop-ahead-of-irma-2017-09-14) last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000.\nCheck out: MarketWatch's Economic Calendar (http://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendars/economic)\nThe S&P 500 index fell 4 points, or 0.2%, to 2,493.55, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 17 points, or less than 0.1%, to 22,174, after setting an intraday record at 22,180.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 22 points, or 0.4%, at 6,436.\nKate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said the data did little to change the policy plan for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the early impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shut down of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher.\n\"CPI was a bit above expectations,\" but market participants can't be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed's 2% target, Warne said. She added that the report was \"not so strong that it's likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.\"\nInflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve's target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-set-to-lose-grip-on-all-time-highs-2017-09-13).\nThe equity market's continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about stock valuations.\n\"The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,\" said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist, in a note.

      "text": "By Mark DeCambre and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatch\nConsumer-price index shows a rise of 0.4%, compared with economist estimates for a 0.3% rise\nU.S. stock benchmarks traded modestly lower on Thursday following data on jobless claims and inflation. The Dow industrials, however, carved out a fresh all-time high in intraday trade, highlighting a record trend for Wall Street equities.\nThe headline U.S. consumer-price index figure came in at 0.4% in August, beating consensus estimates for a gain of 0.3%, while jobless claims on the month came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000.\nS&P 500 index shed 4 points, or 0.2%, at 2,493.55, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 17 points, or less than 0.1%, at 22,174, briefly touching a fresh intraday record at 22,180.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 22 points, or 0.4%, at 6,436.\nKate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said the data did little to change the policy plan for the Federal Reserve. The data also reflected some of the early impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted the shut down of a trove of refiners, resulting in a spike in gasoline prices.\n\"CPI was a bit above expectations but [the market] can't be a surprise that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs that inflation has moved toward the Fed's 2% target,\" Warne said. She added that the report was \"not so strong that it's likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite Index all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-set-to-lose-grip-on-all-time-highs-2017-09-13).\nThe equity markets perpetual run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised questions about stock valuations.\n\"The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,\" said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945.\nRead:Stock market's 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-5-month-win-streak-should-cheer-the-bulls-2017-09-13)\nEconomic and political news: The Federal Reserve \"would love to see inflation picking up as the stagnating price growth has been an issue for the U.S. central bank,\" said Konstantinos Anthis, an analyst at ADS Securities, in a note.\n\"Analysts are expecting a bullish reading from the States today, and this would help the dollar extend its current uptrend.\"\nCheck out:MarketWatch's Economic Calendar (http://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendars/economic)\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in.

      "text": "By Mark DeCambre and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatch\nConsumer-price index shows a rise of 0.4%, compared with economist estimates for a 0.3% increase\nU.S. stock benchmarks traded mostly lower on Thursday dragged into negative territory by declines in retail shares. The Dow industrials, however, carved out a fresh all-time high, highlighting a record trend for Wall Street equities.\nCheck out: MarketWatch's Economic Calendar (http://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendars/economic)\nThe S&P 500 index fell about a point, or less than 0.1%, at 2,497, led by gains in the utilities, as well as the energy and industrials sectors as U.S. traded crude-oil prices retook $50 a barrel (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-aims-to-extend-win-streak-to-4th-day-2017-09-14)for the first time since July. Consumer sectors were the hardest hit, with a downturn in Tiffany & Co., down 5.2%, and Kroger Co. (KR), pressuring the broad-market index.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 50 points, or 0.2%, to 22,207, after setting an intraday record at 22,212.11. The Dow's uptrend was aided by gains in Boeing Co.(BA).\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, slipped 19 points, or 0.3%, at 6,441.\nMark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, said he was sanguine about the outlook for the stock market. \"If you look at the market and you look at the backdrop for equities, it is still pretty good right now,\" he said.\nA reading on consumer prices, known as the consumer-price index, showed an increase of 0.4% (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/higher-rents-gas-boost-inflation-in-august-cpi-shows-2017-09-14) in August, beating consensus estimates for a rise of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-weekly-jobless-claims-drop-ahead-of-irma-2017-09-14) last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000.\nKate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said Thursday's data did little to alter the policy path for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shutdown of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher.\n\"CPI was a bit above expectations,\" but market participants can't be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed's 2% target, Warne said. She said the report was \"not so strong that it's likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.\"\nInflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve's target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-set-to-lose-grip-on-all-time-highs-2017-09-13).\nThe equity market's continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about lofty stock valuations.\n\"The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,\" said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945.\n\"Yeah, you always could run into this situation where you can have a 5% correction. That is always a possibility,\" warned Themis Trading's Kepner. \"But I do not see any major structural issues with the market that could turn into a bear market,\" he said, referring to a decline of at least 20%.\nRead:Stock market's 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-5-month-win-streak-should-cheer-the-bulls-2017-09-13)\nEarlier Thursday, North Korea made fresh threats (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-the-us-to-ashes-and-darkness-2017-09-14)in response to the latest United Nation sanctions, vowing to sink Japan with a nuclear weapon and \"reduce the U.S. mainland into ashes and darkness.\"\nThe aggressive rhetoric comes after the U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted new sanctions against North Korea targeting its exports and oil imports.\nEconomic and political news: Meanwhile, the Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in. Those comments helped to drive the pound to $1.33 against the U.S. dollar in recent trade.\nDon't miss:Inflation data could give traders a surprise (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/inflation-data-could-look-better-than-expected-thursday-analyst-says-2017-09-13)\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-weakens-after-3-day-rise-ahead-of-us-inflation-report-2017-09-14) was 0.2% lower Thursday at 92.308, despite the better-than-expected economic readings, but it has gained about 1% this week, paring its year-to-date loss to around 9.6%.\nOn the political front, President Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to be nearing a deal to give legal status to the children of illegal migrants, but also were disputing what they had agreed on so far. Trump tweeted early Thursday that (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/908272007011282944) no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/top-democrats-announce-daca-deal-with-trump-that-excludes-wall-funding-2017-09-13) with him to enact protections for \"Dreamers\" in exchange for increased border-security measures that don't include funding for a wall.\nOther markets:European stocks (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-pull-back-after-signs-chinas-economy-is-faltering-2017-09-14) bounced around, while Asian markets closed with losses (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-markets-slump-after-disappointing-data-on-chinas-growth-2017-09-13) after weaker-than-anticipated data on China's industrial activity (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-industrial-output-grows-less-than-expected-2017-09-14).\nGold futures were roughly unchanged, paring firmer losses.\nStocks to watch: Shares in Equifax Inc.(EFX) fell 1.2%, putting the credit-reporting company's stock on track to extend a huge selloff sparked by its disclosure last week of a massive data breach. The FTC on Thursday said it was opening an investigation into the breach.\nSee:Equifax down 31% since breach disclosure, erasing $5 billion in market cap (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/equifaxs-stock-has-fallen-31-since-breach-disclosure-erasing-5-billion-in-market-cap-2017-09-14)\nLattice Semiconductor Corp.'s stock (LSCC) rose 0.5% after Trump nixed a pending buyout (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cfius-blocks-sale-of-lattice-semiconductor-to-canyon-bridge-fund-2017-09-13-16911918) of the chip company by a group of Chinese investment funds, citing national security concerns.\nShares of William Lyon Homes(WLH) were trading 4.2% lower after hedge-fund Paulson & Co. said it would sell its stake in the home builder.\nBed Bath & Beyond(BBBY) shares were down 2% in Thursday trade after its price-target was cut by UBS on Friday to $30 from $33.\nApple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) was off 0.6^% after revealing details on its new iPhone lineup and other tech gadgets.\nCheck out: How to get Apple's new iPhone for half price (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-get-the-new-iphone-for-half-price-2017-09-12)\nSee:Trump stops China from buying into U.S. chip industry, but what's next?

      "text": "By Mark DeCambre and Sue Chang, MarketWatch\nAugust consumer price inflation rises faster than expected\nThe Dow closed at a record for a third session in a row on Thursday even as the broader market sagged on the back of weak retail shares.\nThe S&P 500 index shed 2.75 points, or 0.1%, to end at 2,495.62. Consumer sectors were the hardest hit, with Tiffany & Co. down 4.8%, and Kroger Co. (KR) falling 2.2%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 45.30 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 22,203.48, marking its 38th record finish of 2017.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, slipped 31.10 points, or 0.5%, to end at 6,429.08.\nA reading on consumer prices, known as the consumer-price index, showed an increase of 0.4% (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/higher-rents-gas-boost-inflation-in-august-cpi-shows-2017-09-14) in August, beating consensus estimates for a rise of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-weekly-jobless-claims-drop-ahead-of-irma-2017-09-14) last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000.\nKate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said Thursday's data did little to alter the policy path for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shutdown of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher.\n\"CPI was a bit above expectations,\" but market participants can't be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed's 2% target, Warne said. She said the report was \"not so strong that it's likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.\"\nInflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve's target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-set-to-lose-grip-on-all-time-highs-2017-09-13).\nThe equity market's continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about lofty stock valuations.\n\"The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,\" said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945.\nHowever, Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, said he was sanguine about the outlook for the stock market. \"If you look at the market and you look at the backdrop for equities, it is still pretty good right now,\" he said.\n\"Yeah, you always could run into this situation where you can have a 5% correction. That is always a possibility,\" he said. \"But I do not see any major structural issues with the market that could turn into a bear market,\" Kepner added, referring to a decline of at least 20%.\nRead: Stock market's 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-5-month-win-streak-should-cheer-the-bulls-2017-09-13)\nEarlier Thursday, North Korea made more threats (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-the-us-to-ashes-and-darkness-2017-09-14) in response to the latest United Nation sanctions, vowing to sink Japan with a nuclear weapon and \"reduce the U.S. mainland to ashes and darkness.\"\nThe acerbic rhetoric comes after the U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted tougher sanctions against North Korea targeting its exports and oil imports.\nEconomic and political news: The Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in.\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-weakens-after-3-day-rise-ahead-of-us-inflation-report-2017-09-14) slid 0.4% despite the better-than-expected economic readings, but it has gained about 1% this week, paring its year-to-date loss to around 9.6%.\nOn the political front, President Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to be nearing a deal to give legal status to the children of illegal immigrants. Trump tweeted early Thursday that (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/908272007011282944) no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/top-democrats-announce-daca-deal-with-trump-that-excludes-wall-funding-2017-09-13) with him to enact protections for \"Dreamers\" in exchange for increased border-security measures that don't include funding for a wall.\nSee:Orrin Hatch says corporate tax rate could go as low as 20% (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/orrin-hatch-says-corporate-tax-rate-could-go-as-low-as-20-favors-retroactive-cuts-2017-09-14)\nOther markets: European stocks (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-pull-back-after-signs-chinas-economy-is-faltering-2017-09-14) bounced around, while Asian markets closed with losses (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-markets-slump-after-disappointing-data-on-chinas-growth-2017-09-13) after weaker-than-anticipated data on China's industrial activity (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-industrial-output-grows-less-than-expected-2017-09-14).\nCrude-oil futures finished stronger, at one point retaking $50 a barrel (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-aims-to-extend-win-streak-to-4th-day-2017-09-14) for the first time since July. Gold futures settled slightly higher.\nStocks to watch: Shares in Equifax Inc.(EFX) fell 2.4%, putting the credit-reporting company's stock on track to extend a huge selloff sparked by its disclosure last week of a massive data breach. The FTC on Thursday said it was opening an investigation into the breach.\nSee: Equifax down 31% since breach disclosure, erasing $5 billion in market cap (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/equifaxs-stock-has-fallen-31-since-breach-disclosure-erasing-5-billion-in-market-cap-2017-09-14)\nLattice Semiconductor Corp.'s stock (LSCC) rose 0.4% after Trump nixed a pending buyout (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cfius-blocks-sale-of-lattice-semiconductor-to-canyon-bridge-fund-2017-09-13-16911918) of the chip company by a group of Chinese investment funds, citing national security concerns.\nShares of William Lyon Homes(WLH) slumped 5.3% lower after hedge-fund Paulson & Co. said it would sell its stake in the home builder.\nBed Bath & Beyond(BBBY) shares were down 1.7% after its price-target was cut by UBS on Friday to $30 from $33.\nApple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) closed 0.9% lower after revealing details on its new iPhone lineup and other tech gadgets.\nCheck out: How to get Apple's new iPhone for half price (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-get-the-new-iphone-for-half-price-2017-09-12)\nSee: Trump stops China from buying into U.S. chip industry, but what's next? (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-stops-china-from-buying-into-us-chip-industry-but-whats-next-2017-09-13)\n--Victor Reklaitis contributed to this report.\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nSeptember 14, 2017 17:04 ET (21:04 GMT)\nCopyright (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "text": "By Philip Reeves • 10 hours ago In an effort to combat chronic food shortages, President Nicolas Maduro and his ministers are embarking on a campaign to convince Venezuelans to eat rabbits. GK Hart/Vikki Hart/The Image Bank / Getty Images Originally published on September 14, 2017 4:46 pm \nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has unveiled an unusual strategy to help ease the chronic food shortage faced by many of his nation's 30 million people — something he calls Plan Conejo, or \"Plan Rabbit.\" \nMaduro and his ministers are embarking on a somewhat surprising — and to many, alarming — campaign to convince Venezuelans to eat rabbits. They say rabbits will make an excellent source of protein for the large number of people who don't have regular access to red meat or chicken as the result of the country's economic collapse. \nMaduro hopes the small mammal will counter the impact of what he calls a huge \"economic war\" waged against him by \"imperialists\" — notably the United States and his arch-enemy, President Donald Trump. \nDuring a strikingly light-hearted televised discussion, a cheerful-looking Maduro told his cabinet on Tuesday that rabbits have the added advantage of, well, \"breeding like rabbits.\" \nThe rabbit plan, however, has already run into a hole. While rabbit dishes are not uncommon elsewhere in the world, it's rarely found simmering away in Venezuelan kitchens. Rabbits in Venezuela are much more likely to feature as mascots for soccer teams or characters on birthday cards than as dinner. \nFreddy Bernal, the Venezuelan government minister in charge of the plan, acknowledged during the meeting that there is a \"cultural problem.\" His task is to change the widely held Venezuelan view that the bunny rabbit is a loveable friend — much like a kitten or a puppy — and has no place in the human digestive system. \nAnd it's likely to be a difficult task. Bernal told his fellow ministers that during a pilot project for the rabbit plan, a batch of baby bunnies — to be used for breeding and, eventually, tossing into the cooking pot — were distributed to families in poor neighborhoods. \nHe said some people responded by tying bows around the rabbits' necks, giving them cute names, and even cuddling up with them in bed at night. \nReversing this pattern of behavior is part of the Venezuelan government's \"battle to win the economic war,\" Bernal informed his colleagues. He's proposing a nationwide publicity campaign to convince Venezuelans that rabbits are actually \"two and a half kilos of meat that is high in protein and without cholesterol,\" and not mascots or pets after all. \nThe amusement on display among Maduro and his ministers as they discussed the rabbit plan doesn't appear to be shared by many Venezuelans, who've faced serious struggles in recent months to afford — or even find — basic food items. \nContemptuous messages from Maduro's critics — some coupled with cartoons of a gloomy-looking Bugs Bunny — have flooded social media sites. \n\"Are you serious?\" asked Henrique Capriles, one of the most prominent Venezuelan opposition leaders, in a video response to Maduro's plan, posted on social media. \"You want people in this country to start raising rabbits to solve hunger in our country?\" \nThe answer, it seems, is yes.

      "text": "By Mark DeCambre and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatch\nConsumer-price index shows a rise of 0.4%, compared with economist estimates for a 0.3% increase\nU.S. stock benchmarks traded modestly lower on Thursday following data on jobless claims and inflation. The Dow industrials, however, carved out a fresh all-time high in intraday trade, highlighting a record trend for Wall Street equities.\nThe headline U.S. consumer-price index figure came in at 0.4% in August, beating consensus estimates for a gain of 0.3%, while jobless claims on the month came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000.\nS&P 500 index shed 4 points, or 0.2%, at 2,493.55, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 17 points, or less than 0.1%, at 22,174, briefly touching a fresh intraday record at 22,180.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 22 points, or 0.4%, at 6,436.\nKate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said the data did little to change the policy plan for the Federal Reserve. Thursday's inflation reports offered the first read of some of the early impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shut down of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher.\n\"CPI was a bit above expectations but [the market] can't be a surprise that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs that inflation has moved toward the Fed's 2% target,\" Warne said. She added that the report was \"not so strong that it's likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates,\" he said. Inflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve's target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite Index all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-set-to-lose-grip-on-all-time-highs-2017-09-13).\nThe equity market's perpetual run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about stock valuations.\n\"The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,\" said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945.\nRead:Stock market's 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-5-month-win-streak-should-cheer-the-bulls-2017-09-13)\nEconomic and political news: The Federal Reserve \"would love to see inflation picking up as the stagnating price growth has been an issue for the U.S. central bank,\" said Konstantinos Anthis, an analyst at ADS Securities, in a note.\n\"Analysts are expecting a bullish reading from the States today, and this would help the dollar extend its current uptrend.\"\nCheck out:MarketWatch's Economic Calendar (http://www.marketwatch.com/economy-politics/calendars/economic)\nMeanwhile, the Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in.

Trump tweeted early Thursday that (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/908272007011282944) no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/top-democrats-announce-daca-deal-with-trump-that-excludes-wall-funding-2017-09-13) with him to enact protections for \"Dreamers\" in exchange for increased border security measures that don't include funding for a wall.\nOther markets:European stocks (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-pull-back-after-signs-chinas-economy-is-faltering-2017-09-14) bounced around, while Asian markets closed with losses (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-markets-slump-after-disappointing-data-on-chinas-growth-2017-09-13) after weaker-than-anticipated data on China's industrial activity (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-industrial-output-grows-less-than-expected-2017-09-14).\nOil futures traded higher, while gold futures were roughly unchanged, paring firmer losses.\nStocks to watch: Shares in Equifax Inc.(EFX) fell 0.1%, putting the credit-reporting company's stock on track to extend a huge selloff sparked by its disclosure last week of a massive data breach.\nSee:Equifax down 31% since breach disclosure, erasing $5 billion in market cap (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/equifaxs-stock-has-fallen-31-since-breach-disclosure-erasing-5-billion-in-market-cap-2017-09-14)\nLattice Semiconductor Corp.'s stock (LSCC) rose 1.4% after Trump nixed a pending buyout (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cfius-blocks-sale-of-lattice-semiconductor-to-canyon-bridge-fund-2017-09-13-16911918) of the chip company by a group of Chinese investment funds, citing national security concerns.\nSee:Trump stops China from buying into U.S. chip industry, but what's next?

      "text": "No NAFTA Deal Will Be Reached In 2017, Castaneda Speculates By editor • 17 hours ago Related Program: Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. \nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST: \nThe future of the North American Free Trade Agreement has become a major irritant in U.S.-Mexico relations, something President Trump acknowledged before the second round of NAFTA negotiations kicked off in Mexico last week. \n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) \nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Mexico is not happy. But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of years, and everybody left you alone. We got to change this deal. \nMARTIN: Mexico's president says he won't accept any deal that hurts his country's dignity. For more on the Mexican perspective on all this, we turn to former Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda in Mexico City. \nThank you so much for being with us this morning. \nJORGE CASTANEDA: Good morning. Thank you, Rachel. \nMARTIN: How would you characterize the U.S.-Mexico relationship right now? \nCASTANEDA: Well, I think one word would sum it up, rather - lousy in the sense that, in addition to NAFTA, there are a series of other irritants - President Trump's suspension or postponement of Deferred Action for Children (ph) - Childhood Arrivals, or DACA; his insistence on building a wall between the United States and Mexico; rounding up people and increasing mainly arrests but also deportations of Mexican undocumented immigrants in the United States. All of these things have created a very negative feeling towards President Trump, not towards the United States but towards Donald Trump, in Mexico and have placed the Mexican government and the Mexican business community in a very difficult situation, particularly regarding NAFTA, as you said. \nMARTIN: So how does - how do Mexican negotiators then move through that? I mean, how can they compartmentalize their thoughts and feelings about President Trump from the U.S. government that they need to sit down and make a new deal with? \nCASTANEDA: Well, they are trying to negotiate on issues such as NAFTA, and they've had now two rounds. A third round will be in Ottawa in, I think, about a week because the Canadians, of course, are also involved. And the Mexican negotiators are trying to negotiate a new NAFTA without really bringing in the other issues, but the other issues are there. The Mexican foreign minister who's in Washington - was in Washington yesterday talking, among other people, with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and with Senator Schumer about DACA because DACA's a very important question for DREAMers and very important for Mexico. Eighty percent of the DREAMers are Mexican. \nMARTIN: So does that mean... \nCASTANEDA: And suspending... \nMARTIN: Sorry to interrupt you - does that mean that negotiators for NAFTA on the Mexican side would bring up an issue like DACA in those negotiations to use it as some kind of point of leverage? \nCASTANEDA: Not necessarily in the trade negotiations, but bringing it up, yes, as something that has to be addressed. This was a very anti-Mexican decision taken by President Trump. And it's very difficult to negotiate issues like the automobile industry or anti-dumping provisions in the existing NAFTA or rules of origin or a series of things on trade and make believe that the president of the United States did not just decide they've got somewhere near 600,000 Mexican young people who are facing the possibility of deportation as of March 6. So the two issues have to be taken into account. \nBut also, the fact is, the wall has to be taken into account. If he builds the wall, this generates an enormous amount of animosity in Mexico towards the U.S. government because building walls between countries is not very nice, not that there isn't part of a wall already. The wall began to be built back by President Clinton in 1994. But today, the wall... \nMARTIN: Let me ask you in.... \nCASTANEDA: ...DACA, NAFTA, deportations - it's everything. \nMARTIN: In seconds remaining, what do you think the odds are of a new NAFTA by the year-end? \nCASTANEDA: I think they're low. I think there may be a deal by the middle of next year. But by the end of this year, I think the odds are very low. \nMARTIN: Jorge Castaneda is the former foreign minister of Mexico. Thank you so much for your time this morning. \nCASTANEDA: Thank you, Rachel. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2017 WFIT",

The acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, a publicly-traded Oregon company, by Chinese-owned Canyon Bridge Fund could endanger the US government's use of sensitive products the company produces, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The Trump administration has adopted an aggressive stance towards China on trade and national security matters, launching wide-ranging investigations into the national security ramifications of Beijing's trade in aluminum and steel.\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-blo...214043287.html",

      "text": "By Mark DeCambre and Victor Reklaitis, MarketWatch\nAugust consumer price inflation rises faster than expected\nThe Dow closed at a record for a third session in a row on Thursday even as the broader market sagged on the back of weak retail shares.\nThe S&P 500 index shed 2.75 points, or 0.1%, to end at 2,495.62. Consumer sectors were the hardest hit, with Tiffany & Co. down 4.8%, and Kroger Co. (KR) falling 2.2%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 45.30 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 22,203.48, marking its 38th record finish of 2017.\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index , meanwhile, slipped 31.10 points, or 0.5%, to end at 6,429.08.\nA reading on consumer prices, known as the consumer-price index, showed an increase of 0.4% (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/higher-rents-gas-boost-inflation-in-august-cpi-shows-2017-09-14) in August, beating consensus estimates for a rise of 0.3%, while first-time jobless claims (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-weekly-jobless-claims-drop-ahead-of-irma-2017-09-14) last week came in at 284,000, versus forecasts for 300,000.\nKate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, said Thursday's data did little to alter the policy path for the Federal Reserve. Inflation data offered the first read of some of the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which inundated the Houston area and resulted in the shutdown of a trove of crude-oil refineries, driving gasoline prices higher.\n\"CPI was a bit above expectations,\" but market participants can't be surprised that higher gasoline prices and some other expected inputs moved inflation toward the Fed's 2% target, Warne said. She said the report was \"not so strong that it's likely to change views that the Fed will continue to be cautious and slow in raising interest rates.\"\nInflation readings have been trending below the Federal Reserve's target and leading some to question whether the central bank would feel comfortable lifting benchmark interest rates once more in 2017.\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq Composite all gained between 0.1% and 0.2%, finishing at all-time closing highs for a second straight session (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stocks-set-to-lose-grip-on-all-time-highs-2017-09-13).\nThe equity market's continued run to new heights, with the bull market in its ninth year, has raised concerns about lofty stock valuations.\n\"The S&P 500 continues to confound skeptical investors, as it adds to its above-average number of new highs,\" said Sam Stovall, CFRA's chief investment strategist, in a note. The benchmark has scored 33 record closes this year, more than twice the annual average since 1945.\nHowever, Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading, said he was sanguine about the outlook for the stock market. \"If you look at the market and you look at the backdrop for equities, it is still pretty good right now,\" he said.\n\"Yeah, you always could run into this situation where you can have a 5% correction. That is always a possibility,\" he said. \"But I do not see any major structural issues with the market that could turn into a bear market,\" Kepner added, referring to a decline of at least 20%.\nRead: Stock market's 5-month win streak should cheer the bulls (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stock-markets-5-month-win-streak-should-cheer-the-bulls-2017-09-13)\nEarlier Thursday, North Korea made more threats (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-the-us-to-ashes-and-darkness-2017-09-14) in response to the latest United Nation sanctions, vowing to sink Japan with a nuclear weapon and \"reduce the U.S. mainland to ashes and darkness.\"\nThe acerbic rhetoric comes after the U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously adopted tougher sanctions against North Korea targeting its exports and oil imports.\nEconomic and political news: The Bank of England on Thursday kept its key interest rate on hold and made no changes to its quantitative-easing program, but warned that rates could rise faster than traders currently are pricing in.\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dollar-weakens-after-3-day-rise-ahead-of-us-inflation-report-2017-09-14) slid 0.4% despite the better-than-expected economic readings, but it has gained about 1% this week, paring its year-to-date loss to around 9.6%.\nOn the political front, President Donald Trump and top Democrats appear to be nearing a deal to give legal status to the children of illegal immigrants. Trump tweeted early Thursday that (https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/908272007011282944) no deal had been reached yet, after Democrats late Wednesday said they had an agreement (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/top-democrats-announce-daca-deal-with-trump-that-excludes-wall-funding-2017-09-13) with him to enact protections for \"Dreamers\" in exchange for increased border-security measures that don't include funding for a wall.\nSee:Orrin Hatch says corporate tax rate could go as low as 20% (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/orrin-hatch-says-corporate-tax-rate-could-go-as-low-as-20-favors-retroactive-cuts-2017-09-14)\nOther markets: European stocks (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/european-stocks-pull-back-after-signs-chinas-economy-is-faltering-2017-09-14) bounced around, while Asian markets closed with losses (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-markets-slump-after-disappointing-data-on-chinas-growth-2017-09-13) after weaker-than-anticipated data on China's industrial activity (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-industrial-output-grows-less-than-expected-2017-09-14).\nCrude-oil futures finished stronger, at one point retaking $50 a barrel (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-aims-to-extend-win-streak-to-4th-day-2017-09-14) for the first time since July. Gold futures settled slightly higher.\nStocks to watch: Shares in Equifax Inc.(EFX) fell 2.4%, putting the credit-reporting company's stock on track to extend a huge selloff sparked by its disclosure last week of a massive data breach. The FTC on Thursday said it was opening an investigation into the breach.\nSee: Equifax down 31% since breach disclosure, erasing $5 billion in market cap (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/equifaxs-stock-has-fallen-31-since-breach-disclosure-erasing-5-billion-in-market-cap-2017-09-14)\nLattice Semiconductor Corp.'s stock (LSCC) rose 0.4% after Trump nixed a pending buyout (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/cfius-blocks-sale-of-lattice-semiconductor-to-canyon-bridge-fund-2017-09-13-16911918) of the chip company by a group of Chinese investment funds, citing national security concerns.\nShares of William Lyon Homes(WLH) slumped 5.3% lower after hedge-fund Paulson & Co. said it would sell its stake in the home builder.\nBed Bath & Beyond(BBBY) shares were down 1.7% after its price-target was cut by UBS on Friday to $30 from $33.\nApple Inc.'s stock (AAPL) closed 0.9% lower after revealing details on its new iPhone lineup and other tech gadgets.\nCheck out: How to get Apple's new iPhone for half price (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-get-the-new-iphone-for-half-price-2017-09-12)\nSee: Trump stops China from buying into U.S. chip industry, but what's next? (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-stops-china-from-buying-into-us-chip-industry-but-whats-next-2017-09-13)\n--Victor Reklaitis contributed to this report.\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nSeptember 14, 2017 16:54 ET (20:54 GMT)\nCopyright (c) 2017 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Police are calling the incident at terrorist attack, the fifth in Britain this year. McClatchy UK threat level raised to \"critical\" after subway bombing By JILL LAWLESS and GREGORY KATZ Associated Press September 15, 2017 1:52 PM LONDON \nA homemade bomb planted in a rush-hour subway car exploded in London on Friday, injuring 29 people and prompting authorities to raise Britain's terrorism threat level to \"critical,\" meaning another attack may be imminent. \nThe early morning blast sparked a huge manhunt for the perpetrators of what police said was the fourth terrorist attack in the British capital this year. \nPrime Minister Theresa May, acting on the recommendation of the Joint Terrorism Analysis Center, raised the country's threat level from \"severe\" to \"critical\" — its highest possible level. May said military troops would augment the police presence in a \"proportionate and sensible step.\" \nEarlier, May said the device had been \"intended to cause significant harm.\" \nStill, to the relief of authorities and Londoners, experts said the bomb — hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag — only partially exploded, sparing the city much worse carnage. \n\"I would say this was a failed high-explosive device,\" Chris Hunter, a former British army bomb expert, said of the blast, which caused no serious injuries. \nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said was carried out by an affiliated unit. \nThe bomb went off around 8:20 a.m. as the train, carrying commuters from the suburbs — including many school children — was at Parsons Green station in the southwest of the city. \nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw \"out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train,\" followed by \"an acrid chemical smell.\" \nCommuter Lauren Hubbard said she was on the train when she heard a loud bang. \n\"I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming toward us,\" Hubbard said. She said her instinct was \"just run,\" and she fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend. \nChaos ensued as hundreds of people, some of them suffering burns, poured from the train, which can hold up to 800 people. \n\"I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying. There were little kids clinging onto the back of me,\" said another commuter, Ryan Barnett. \nPassenger Luke Walmsley said it was \"like every man for himself to get down the stairs.\" \n\"People were just pushing,\" he added. \"There were nannies or mums asking where their children were.\" Related stories from The Bellingham Herald Trump: London bombing is reason to expand US travel ban \nPolice and health officials said 29 people were treated in London hospitals, most of them for flash burns. None of the injuries were serious or life-threatening, the emergency services said. \nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the Underground's District Line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter (150-foot) cordon around the scene while they secured the device and launched a search for those who planted it. \nThe Metropolitan Police said hundreds of detectives, along with agents of the domestic spy agency MI5, were looking at surveillance camera footage, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. \nSpeaking to reporters late Friday, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police were making \"good progress\" and that the public should be reassured that more police and troops will be on the streets. \n\"We are only aware of one device,\" he said. \"We have remnants of that device. We are chasing down suspects.\" He refused to provide further details, except to say the bomb involved the \"detonation of an improvised explosive device.\" \nAmong the questions authorities were seeking to answer: What was the device made from, and was it meant to go off when it did, in a leafy, affluent part of the city far from London's top tourist sites? \nBritish media reported that the bomb included a timer. Lewis Herrington, a terrorism expert at Loughborough University, said that would set it apart from suicide attacks like those on the London subway in 2005 or at Manchester Arena in May, in which the attackers \"all wanted to die.\" \nPhotos taken inside the train showed a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag, with flames and what appeared to be wires emerging from the top. \nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that from the photos it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact. \n\"They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse,\" he said. \nHunter, the explosives expert, said it appeared that \"there was a bang, a bit of a flash, and that would suggest that, potentially, some of the explosive detonated, the detonator detonated, but much of the explosive was effectively inert.\" \nPolice and ambulances were on the scene within minutes of the blast, a testament to their experience at responding to violent attacks in London. The city has been a target for decades: from Irish Republican Army bombers, right-wing extremists and, more recently, attackers inspired by al-Qaida or the Islamic State group. \nBritain has seen four other terrorist attacks this year, which killed a total of 36 people. The other attacks in London — near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London — used vehicles and knives. Similar methods have been used in attacks across Europe, including in Nice, Stockholm, Berlin and Barcelona. \nThe last time the country's threat level was raised to critical, was after the May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people. \nBritish authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since the van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. Police and MI5 say that at any given time they are running about 500 counterterrorism investigations involving 3,000 individuals. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been a \"shift\" in the terrorism threat, with attackers using a wide range of methods to try to inflict carnage. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, said London police needed more resources to fight the threat. Police budgets have been cut since 2010 by Britain's Conservative government. \nThe London Underground, which handles 5 million journeys a day, has been targeted several times in the past. In July 2005, suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode. \nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode. \nU.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Friday's attack, tweeting that it was carried out \"by a loser terrorist,\" and adding that \"these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.\" \nThe British prime minister gently rebuked the president for his tweets. \"I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,\" May said.

      "text": "Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi to skip UN General Assembly Eugene Kaspersky's spokespersons says if he can get an expedited visa, he \"looks forward to publicly-addressing the allegations\" about his anti-virus company and products. A source familiar with US inquiries into Kaspersky Lab said the co-founder and chief executive of the Moscow-based anti-virus firm, Eugene Kaspersky, had not been to the United States since spring of 2015. (Reuters/Archive) \nEugene Kaspersky, the co-founder and chief executive of Moscow-based anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab, said on Thursday he accepted an invitation to testify to US lawmakers later this month over the security of his company's products, but that he needed an expedited visa in order to do so. \nThe appearance before Congress would be Kaspersky's most high-profile attempt to address long-standing accusations that his firm may be conducting espionage on behalf of the Kremlin. \nThe testimony would also provide a rare public airing of the tensions in cyberspace between the United States and Russia, as Kaspersky Lab has argued it has been caught in a proxy battle over broader tensions between the two countries. \nUS intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a multipronged digital influence operation last year in an attempt to help Donald Trump win the White House, a charge Moscow denies. \nIn an email to Reuters, Kaspersky said, \"I appreciate and accept the invitation to testify before the US House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and if I can get an expedited visa, I look forward to publicly addressing the allegations about my company and its products.\" \nThe invitation came a day after the Trump administration told US government agencies to remove Kaspersky Lab products from their networks, saying it was concerned the company was vulnerable to Russian government influence and that using its anti-virus software could jeopardize national security. \nThe committee said it invited Kaspersky to testify on September 27. US government and private-sector cyber experts were also invited. \nFears about Kaspersky Lab have metastasised in recent months as US lawmakers and intelligence officials have tried to understand the full range of Russia's cyber-enabled meddling in the 2016 presidential election. \nThe Russian embassy in the United States called the Kaspersky Lab ban \"regrettable\" and said it delayed the prospects of restoring bilateral ties. \nIt said the move was part of a series of steps that would detract from mutual priorities, such as fighting terrorism, and that the United States should reconsider Russia's proposal to set up a joint cyber security group - an idea Trump has entertained but that Republicans and Democrats widely panned. \n\"Whatever it takes\" \nIn an opinion piece published by Forbes on Thursday, Eugene Kaspersky defended his company, which he said had been targeted for nearly five years by unsubstantiated rumors that have yielded no proof of any wrongdoing. \n\"I've repeatedly offered to meet with government officials, testify before the US Congress, provide the company's source code for an official audit and discuss any other means to help address any questions the US government has about Kaspersky Lab - whatever it takes, I will do it,\"Kaspersky wrote. \nBut Kaspersky told NBC News in July that he was not currently traveling to the United States because he was \"worried about some unexpected problems\" if he did, citing the \"ruined relationship\" between Moscow and Washington. \nKaspersky Lab did not immediately respond when asked when its chief executive was last in the United States. \nA source familiar with US inquiries into the company said he had not been to the United States since spring of 2015. \nTwo sources familiar with the inquiries said Kaspersky has been most concerned about the probe of allegations that the company sabotaged competitors in the anti-virus industry through information-sharing programs. \nAlso on Thursday, the US Senate came a step closer to passing legislation that would codify the Trump administration's ban, voting to expand an amendment to a pending defense policy spending bill to prohibit both federal civilian and military agencies from using Kaspersky Lab products.

      "text": "BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- The Latest on a speech by a conservative commentator at the University of California, Berkeley (all times local):\n10:10 p.m.\nUniversity of California, Berkeley police say there have been four to five arrests related to protests in Berkeley, all on city property.\nHundreds protested outside a speech by former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro, but the demonstrations were mostly peaceful.\nUniversity spokesman Dan Mogulof called Thursday&apos;s Shapiro speech \"a successful event\" and says the university is committed to hosting speakers like Shapiro in the future.\nHundreds of protesters remain on city streets, though the event has wrapped up.\nA least three were arrested for carrying a banned weapon.\nBerkeley police say 29-year-old Michael Paul Sullivan of Hayward was arrested, along with 44-year-old Sarah Roark and 20-year-old Hannah Benjamin. Benjamin is also accused of battery on a police officer.\n---\n8:40 p.m.\nA few hundred people are protesting outside a hall where conservative commentator Ben Shapiro is speaking at the University of California, Berkeley.\nThe demonstrators are peaceful, with some chanting against fascism, white supremacists and President Donald Trump.\nOthers were holed up Thursday inside a student building. Earlier, they waved signs from a pedestrian walkway protesting the university&apos;s decision to allow the event featuring the former editor at Breitbart News.\nInside the hall, Shapiro addressed a friendly crowd. He encouraged people to hold civil discussions with people who have different opinions, saying that&apos;s what America is all about.\nHe condemned white supremacists as \"a very small select group of absolutely terrible people who believe absolutely terrible things.\"\nThe campus and surrounding Berkeley streets are under tight security after a series of previous events turned violent.\n---\nThis item has been corrected to remove a reference to the students inside the building holding signs.\n---\n8 p.m.\nBerkeley police say they have arrested two people during protests over a speech by a conservative commentator at the University of California, Berkeley.\nCity police say 20-year-old Hannah Benjamin was arrested Thursday for battery on a police officer and carrying a banned weapon. Meanwhile, 44-year-old Sarah Roark was taken into custody for carrying a banned weapon.\nThe arrests were announced on the police Twitter account.\nThere was a heavy police presence in Berkeley as former Breitbart News editor Ben Shapiro was speaking.\nCampus Republicans invited him to come as part of his tour called \"Campus Thuggery.\"\nDozens of demonstrators were outside the hall where he was speaking, but police kept the two sides apart.\n---\n6:30 p.m.\nDozens of people have lined up to hear a speech at the University of California, Berkeley that has prompted massive security as officials fear violent demonstrations.\nPolice with riot gear have surrounded the plaza in front of Zellerbach Hall, where the former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro is set to speak later Thursday.\nEighteen-year-old high school senior Nick Handley says he tried to get others to come to Berkeley with him from Modesto, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) east of San Francisco.\nBut he says they were scared about the potential violence outside the speech by Shapiro dubbed Campus Thuggery.\nHandley says the heavy police presence is sad, particularly since taxpayer money is being spent.\nUC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof says the security could cost $600,000.\n---\n4:15 p.m.\nProtesters opposed to a scheduled speech by a conservative commentator at the University of California, Berkeley say they&apos;re disappointed they&apos;re being kept out of the school&apos;s main plaza because of heightened security.\nRaphael Kadaris is an organizer with Refuse Fascism, which had planned to protest at the university&apos;s Sproul Plaza ahead of the appearance by former Breitbart News editor Ben Shapiro.\nUC Berkeley Police Chief Margot Bennett says protesters can demonstrate on nearby streets, about a block away. Campus police closed the plaza Thursday afternoon and stopped allowing people to enter.\nKadaris says his group wants to criticize white supremacy, misogyny, xenophobia and fascism. He says \"the police and the chancellor and the university better not attack us.\"\nThe speech by Shapiro is set for Thursday night. He was invited by campus Republicans.\n---\n1 p.m.\nSeveral streets around the University of California, Berkeley, have been closed off with concrete and plastic barriers ahead of a campus appearance by former Breitbart News editor Ben Shapiro.\nSchool officials say they have sealed off Sproul Plaza - the central hub of the campus - and created a perimeter around several buildings. They say they are ensuring the safety of students and those attending Shapiro&apos;s sold-out appearance Thursday evening.\nUC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof says the school is committed to hosting a safe and successful event.\nPolice Chief Margo Bennett says there will be several checkpoints outside the 1,000-seat auditorium, and officers will confiscate banned items, including shields, masks, bandanas, poles and torches.\nThe city and campus have become a flashpoint this year for the country&apos;s political divisions, drawing extremist groups from the left and right.\n---\n8 a.m.\nThe University of California, Berkeley is ramping up security as it braces to host conservative commentator Ben Shapiro Thursday night.\nAuthorities plan to seal off the campus&apos; central hub, Sproul Plaza, with a \"closed perimeter\" around several buildings including where Shapiro is set to speak to a crowd of 1,000.\nThe university says there will be \"an increased and highly visible police presence\" and police will quickly arrest protesters wielding weapons or wearing masks.\nThe city and campus at UC Berkeley have become a flashpoint for the country&apos;s political divisions, drawing extremist groups from the left- and right-wing.\nFour political demonstrations have turned violent in Berkeley since February, prompting officers to come up with new strategies to control rowdy and sometimes dangerous crowds.\nCampus Republicans invited Shapiro to speak.\n© 2017 The Associated Press .

      "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The Latest on another missile launch by North Korea (all times local):\n12:30 a.m.\nAn emergency response official on Japan&apos;s northern island of Hokkaido says business has been usual most of the morning after a North Korean missile flew over the island.\nWarning sirens to alert residents blared twice - once immediately after the launch Friday and the second time just after the missile passed above their heads.\nHokkaido prefectural emergency official Shuji Koshida said local trains and subways briefly stopped for safety checks but there was no panicking or traffic jams.\nKoshida said there were no reports of debris or damage and business was usual. It occurred while many people were still at home, waking up or getting ready for school or work.\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo that the missile was in Japanese space from 7:04 a.m. to 7:06 a.m. before landing in the ocean about 2,200 kilometers (1,200 miles) east.\n---\n12:10 p.m.\nAustralia&apos;s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull harshly condemned North Korea&apos;s missile launch as \"reckless and dangerous,\" and called for even tougher punishments against Pyongyang.\n\"This is another example of why it is vitally important to continue to tighten those economic sanctions on North Korea,\" Turnbull said.\nEarlier this week, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions on North Korea after it carried out its sixth and strongest nuclear test on Sept. 3.\nTurnbull told reporters the launch Friday morning, along with \"violent outbursts of North Korean propaganda threatening Japan and the United States overnight,\" were signs \"that the sanctions are working.\"\nHe called for greater global action to deter North Korea from escalating hostilities, noting that China had the greatest economic leverage over Pyongyang.\nThe possibility of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un starting a war would be a \"catastrophe,\" he said. \"He would be signing a suicide note. That would be the end for his government, and thousands and thousands of people would die.\"\n---\n11:20 a.m.\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is calling on all nations to take new measures against Kim Jong Un&apos;s regime after North Korea&apos;s latest missile launch.\nHe said Friday that U.N. Security Council resolutions approved earlier this week \"represent the floor, not the ceiling, of the actions we should take.\"\nTillerson&apos;s statement singled out China and Russia, which he said \"must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.\"\nThe resolutions prohibit any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers and cap Pyongyang&apos;s imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. China supplies North Korea with most of its oil. Russia is the largest employer of North Korean forced labor.\nAlso, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono says he talked with Tillerson after the launch and they agreed on the need for the international society to come together to apply pressure on the North to follow the latest U.N. resolution.\n---\n10:55 a.m.\nPresident Moon Jae-in has instructed South Korean officials to pursue \"stern\" diplomatic and military measures to discourage North Korea from further provocations after its latest missile launch.\nPresidential spokesman Park Su-hyun said Friday after a National Security Council meeting that Moon also called for stronger preparation against the threat of biological and chemical weapons attacks by the North.\nPark says Moon also instructed officials to closely assess North Korean claims following its nuclear test on Sept. 3 that its nuclear weapons are capable of pulling off electromagnetic pulse attacks.\nElectromagnetic pulse refers to an intense wave of electrical energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear weapon that could theoretically knock off electrical grids and communication facilities.\nMoon also ordered his military to conduct a live-fire drill of the Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile in a show of force. South Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff says the drill was conducted in consideration to the distance to an airport in Sunan, Pyongyang, which was about 250 kilometers (155 miles) away.\nThe JCS says the latest North Korean missile was fired from Sunan but didn&apos;t specify the airport as the launch site.\n---\n9:45 a.m.\nThe U.N. Security Council has scheduled an emergency meeting on North Korea&apos;s missile launch.\nEthiopia&apos;s U.N. Mission, which holds the council presidency this month, said closed-door consultations will take place Friday afternoon at the request of the United States and Japan.\nThe missile flew over northern Japan before falling into the Pacific and follows North Korea&apos;s sixth and most powerful nuclear test Sept. 3.\nThe launch also came days before world leaders gather at the United Nations starting Monday for their annual ministerial meeting. Earlier this week, the Security Council adopted new sanctions in response to the nuclear test that ban all textile exports and prohibit any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers - two key sources of hard currency for the country.\nU.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that combined with previous sanctions the U.N. has now banned 90 percent of North Korea&apos;s exports reported in 2016.\n---\n9:40 a.m.\nJapan&apos;s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has denounced North Korea&apos;s missile launch as a reckless act that trampled on efforts toward a peaceful solution.\nAbe said Friday&apos;s launch came on the heels of the U.N. Security Council&apos;s resolution and \"trampled on the international society&apos;s desire for a peaceful solution\" and that \"North Korea&apos;s reckless act is absolutely unacceptable.\"\nAbe said the missile launch underscored the need to fully achieve the purpose of the U.N. Security Council sanctions that ban textile imports and prohibit new work permits for North Koreans in jobs abroad. Abe said international society needs solidarity now more than ever before.\nAbe spoke Friday morning as he was returning from a visit to India.\n---\n9:15 a.m.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has called the latest missile launch a reckless act by the North Koreans.\nMattis was at the U.S. Strategic Command headquarters in Nebraska at the time of the launch and said afterward the missile \"was fired over Japan and put millions of Japanese in duck and cover.\"\nThe missile fired Friday morning Asia time flew over Japan&apos;s northern island of Hokkaido before landing in the Pacific. Warning messages were sent to residents.\nAsked about a possible American military response, Mattis said, \"I don&apos;t want to talk on that yet.\" He said President Donald Trump had been fully briefed on the event.\n---\n8:58 a.m.\nThe U.S. Pacific Command says the North Korean missile fired over Japan was an intermediate range missile.\nThe Pacific Command said Friday that the North American Aerospace Defense Command determined the missile did not pose a threat to North America.\nNorth Korea previously fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile over Japan on Aug. 29 in what it called a \"meaningful prelude\" to containing Guam and the start of more missile tests targeting the Pacific Ocean.\nJapan&apos;s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga has denounced North Korea&apos;s latest launch, saying he is conveying \"strong anger\" on behalf of the Japanese people.\nSuga says the missile flew over Japan&apos;s northern main island of Hokkaido and landed about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) off its eastern coast in the Pacific Ocean.\nSuga says Japan \"will not tolerate the repeated and excessive provocations.\"\n---\n8 a.m.\nSouth Korea&apos;s military says North Korea fired an unidentified missile from its capital Pyongyang that flew over Japan before landing in the northern Pacific Ocean.\nIt was the second aggressive test-flight over the territory of the close U.S. ally in less than a month and it followed the sixth and most powerful nuclear test by North Korea to date on Sept. 3.\nSouth Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Friday that the missile traveled about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles).\nThe joint chiefs say the missile was launched from Sunan, the site of Pyongyang&apos;s international airport.\nThe airport also was used to fire a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile that flew over northern Japan in what it declared a \"meaningful prelude\" to containing the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam and the start of more ballistic missile launches.\n---\n7:30 a.m.\nSouth Korea&apos;s military says North Korea fired an unidentified missile from its capital Pyongyang in a continuation of weapons tests following its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date on Sept. 3.\nSouth Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Friday that the missile was launched from Sunan, the site of Pyongyang&apos;s international airport.\nThe North last month used the airport to fire a Hwasong-12 intermediate range missile that flew over northern Japan in what it declared as a \"meaningful prelude\" to containing the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam and the start of more ballistic missile launches targeting the Pacific Ocean.\nSouth Korea&apos;s Defense Ministry says the country&apos;s military conducted a live-fire ballistic missile drill in response to the North&apos;s launch.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has scheduled a National Security Council meeting to discuss the launch.\n ",

      "title": "North Korea fires missile over Japan in longest-ever flight",
      "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea conducted its longest-ever test flight of a ballistic missile Friday, sending an intermediate-range weapon hurtling over U.S. ally Japan into the northern Pacific Ocean in a launch that signals both defiance to its rivals and a big technological advance.\nSince President Donald Trump threatened the North with \"fire and fury\" in August, Pyongyang has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, threatened to send missiles into the waters around the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam and launched two missiles of increasing range over Japan. July saw its first tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles that could strike deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected.\nThe growing frequency, power and confidence displayed by these tests seem to confirm what governments and outside experts have long feared: North Korea is closer than ever to its goal of building a military arsenal that can viably target both U.S. troops in Asia and the U.S. homeland. This, in turn, is meant to allow North Korea greater military freedom in the region by raising doubts in Seoul and Tokyo that Washington would risk the annihilation of a U.S. city to protect its Asian allies.\nSouth Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the latest missile traveled about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and reached a maximum height of 770 kilometers (478 miles). Guam, which is the home of important U.S. military assets, is 3,400 kilometers (2,112 miles) away from North Korea.\nNorth Korea has repeatedly vowed to continue these tests amid what it calls U.S. hostility - by which it means the presence of nearly 80,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan and South Korea. Robust international diplomacy on the issue has been stalled for years, and there&apos;s little sign that senior officials from Pyongyang and Washington might sit down to discuss ways to slow the North&apos;s determined march toward inclusion among the world&apos;s nuclear weapons powers.\nFriday&apos;s test, which Seoul said was the 19th launch of a ballistic missile by North Korea this year, triggered sirens and warning messages in northern Japan but caused no apparent damage to aircraft or ships. It was the second missile fired over Japan in less than a month. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3.\nThe missile was launched from Sunan, the location of Pyongyang&apos;s international airport and the origin of the earlier missile that flew over Japan. Analysts have speculated the new test was of the same intermediate-range missile launched in that earlier flight, the Hwasong-12, and was meant to show Washington that the North can hit Guam if it chose to do so.\nIt was met with the usual outrage. South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered his military to conduct a live-fire ballistic missile drill in response and instructed government officials to pursue \"stern\" measures to discourage further provocations. South Korea&apos;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said one of the two missiles fired in the drill hit a sea target about 250 kilometers (155 miles) away, which was approximately the distance to Pyongyang&apos;s Sunan, but the other failed in flight shortly after launch.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis both called the North Korean launch a reckless act. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency closed-door meeting to be held Friday afternoon in New York. Trump has not commented.\nSouth Korean experts have said North Korea wants to make missiles flying over Japan an accepted norm as it seeks to win more military space in a region dominated by its enemies.\nNorth Korea initially flight-tested the Hwasong-12 and the ICBM model Hwasong-14 at highly lofted angles to reduce their range and avoid neighboring countries.\nThe two launches over Japan indicate North Korea is moving toward using angles close to operational to determine whether its warheads can survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry and detonate properly.\nNorth Korea&apos;s August launch over Japan came weeks after it threatened to fire a salvo of Hwasong-12s toward Guam and bracket the island with \"enveloping\" missile fire.\nNorth Korea has been accelerating its nuclear weapons development under leader Kim Jong Un, a third-generation dictator who has conducted four of North Korea&apos;s six nuclear tests since taking power in 2011. The weapons being tested include hard-to-detect solid-fuel missiles designed to be launched from road mobile launchers or submarines.\nNorth Korea claimed its latest nuclear test was a detonation of a thermonuclear weapon built for its ICBMs.\nThe U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions earlier this week over the nuclear test. They ban all textile exports and prohibit any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers - two key sources of hard currency. They also prohibit North Korea from importing all natural gas liquids and condensates, and cap Pyongyang&apos;s imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.\nNorth Korea&apos;s Foreign Ministry denounced the U.N. sanctions and said the North will \"redouble its efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country&apos;s sovereignty and right to existence.\"\n---\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n© 2017 The Associated Press .

      "text": "  2:57 PM CDT Sep 15, 2017 UK terror level 'critical,' manhunt on after bomb wounds 29 on London subway   2:57 PM CDT Sep 15, 2017 By Jill Lawless LONDON — \nA homemade bomb planted in a rush-hour subway car injured 29 people in London on Friday, sparking a huge manhunt for the perpetrators of what police said was the fourth terrorist attack in the British capital this year. \nUK officials have also raised the country's terrorism threat level to \"critical\" —meaning another attack is expected shortly. Advertisement \nPrime Minister Theresa May said the device “was intended to cause significant harm,” but to the relief of authorities and Londoners, the bomb — hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag — only partially exploded, sparing the city much worse carnage. \n“I would say this was a failed high-explosive device,” Chris Hunter, a former British army bomb expert, said of the blast, which caused no serious injuries. \nThe bomb went off around 8:20 a.m. as the train, carrying commuters from the suburbs — including many school children — was at Parsons Green station in the southwest of the city. \nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw “out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train,” followed by “an acrid chemical smell.” \nCommuter Lauren Hubbard said she was on the train when she heard a loud bang.“I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming toward us,” Hubbard said. She said her instinct was “just run,” and she fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend. \nChaos ensued as hundreds of people, some of them suffering burns, poured from the train, which can hold up to 800 people. \n“I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying. There were little kids clinging onto the back of me,” said another commuter, Ryan Barnett. \nPassenger Luke Walmsley said it was “like every man for himself to get down the stairs.” \n“People were just pushing,” he added. “There were nannies or mums asking where their children were.” \nPolice and health officials said 29 people were treated in London hospitals, most of them for flash burns. None of the injuries were serious or life-threatening, the emergency services said. \nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the Underground’s District Line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter (150-foot) cordon around the scene while they secured the device and launched a search for those who planted it. \nThe Metropolitan Police said hundreds of detectives, along with agents of the domestic spy agency MI5, were looking at surveillance camera footage, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. \nAmong questions they were rushing to answer: What was the device made from, and was it meant to go off when it did, in a leafy, affluent part of the city far from London’s top tourist sites? \nBritish media reported that the bomb included a timer. Lewis Herrington, a terrorism expert at Loughborough University, said that would set it apart from suicide attacks like those on the London subway in 2005 or at Manchester Arena in May, in which the attackers “all wanted to die.” \nPhotos taken inside the train showed a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag, with flames and what appeared to be wires emerging from the top. \nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that from the photos it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact. \n“They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse,” he said. \nHunter, the explosives expert, said it appeared that “there was a bang, a bit of a flash, and that would suggest that, potentially, some of the explosive detonated, the detonator detonated, but much of the explosive was effectively inert.” \nPolice and ambulances were on the scene within minutes of the blast, a testament to their experience at responding to violent attacks in London. The city has been a target for decades: from Irish Republican Army bombers, right-wing extremists and, more recently, attackers inspired by al-Qaida or the Islamic State group. \nIn its recent Inspire magazine, al-Qaida urged supporters to target trains. \nBritain has seen four other terrorist attacks this year, which killed a total of 36 people. The other attacks in London — near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London — used vehicles and knives. Similar methods have been used in attacks across Europe, including in Nice, Stockholm, Berlin and Barcelona. \nIn contrast Friday’s attack involved the “detonation of an improvised explosive device,” said Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police. \nAfter chairing a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee, the prime minister said that Britain’s official threat level from terrorism remained at “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely, and was not being raised to critical. \nThe country’s threat level was briefly raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, after the May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people. \nBritish authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since the van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. Police and MI5 say that at any given time they are running about 500 counterterrorism investigations involving 3,000 individuals. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been a “shift” in the terrorism threat, with attackers using a wide range of methods to try to inflict carnage. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, said London police needed more resources to fight the threat. Police budgets have been cut since 2010 by Britain’s Conservative government. \nThe London Underground, which handles 5 million journeys a day, has been targeted several times in the past. In July 2005, suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode. \nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode. \nU.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Friday’s attack, tweeting that it was carried out “by a loser terrorist,” and adding that “these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.” \nThe British prime minister gently rebuked the president for his tweets. \n“I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” May said.___ Gregory Katz in London and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.",

More > Harvard University has reversed its decision to name Chelsea Manning a visiting fellow a day after CIA Director Mike Pompeo scrapped a planned appearance over the designation for Manning, a soldier who was convicted of leaking classified information. More > By JOCELYN GECKER and SOPHIA TAREENAssociated Press \nBERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Mixed signals from Washington over a possible agreement to preserve protections for young immigrants are increasing anxiety and confusion on college campuses, where the stakes are high. \nAmid the uncertainty, colleges and universities are stepping up efforts to protect students enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, telling them to be hopeful but plan for the worst. \nHarvard University has opened a round-the-clock emergency hotline for immigrants in the program. The University of Illinois at Chicago has posted advice on what to do if federal agents show up on campus. UC Berkeley, the University of San Francisco and many other campuses are offering free legal advice to immigrant students now facing fears of deportation. Nearly sixty college and university presidents sent a letter urging congressional leaders to make the program permanent out of \"moral imperative and a national necessity.\" \nAn estimated 350,000 of the country's nearly 800,000 DACA recipients are currently enrolled in school, most at colleges or universities, according to a 46-state survey this year by the advocacy group Center for American Progress. Under the program, they were protected from deportation and allowed to legally work in the United States with two-year permits. \nThe top congressional Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, emerged from a White House dinner Wednesday to say they had reached a deal with President Donald Trump to save DACA. But amid backlash from conservative Republicans, Trump said Thursday that they were \"fairly close\" but nothing had been agreed to. \nIt was the latest in a confusing back-and-forth on the subject that started last week when the Trump administration announced it was rescinding the program, but gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix. \n\"I don't think anybody can put much faith in the statement that there is a deal, because so much can change,\" said John Trasvina, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law and an immigration expert who worked in Washington under the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"I've seen tons of times when people think they have an immigration deal, and then it goes away.\" \nUnder the Trump administration plan, those already enrolled in DACA remain covered until their two-year permits expire. If their permits expire before March, 5, 2018, they can renew them for another two years as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the program isn't accepting new applications. \nThe University of San Francisco, which has about 80 DACA recipients, is advising students to adhere to that deadline and is raising money to help pay the $495 renewal fee. \nDespite reassurances from schools that they'll be able to continue attending classes, many students are anxious. They're worried about how they'll pay for school if they can't work. \nAna Maciel, a 23-year-old who works full time to put herself through a University of San Francisco education Master's program, says she's been on \"an emotional roller coaster.\" She fears being deported to Mexico, the country she left at age 3, and wonders if it's smart to keep investing in school if she can't work afterward. \n\"Is this what I should spend my money on?\" Maciel says about her $8,000 tuition. \"Everything is up in the air.\" \nTrump's DACA announcement on Sept. 5 came after 10 Republican attorneys general threatened to sue in an attempt to halt the program. They were led by Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas, which has the second-highest number of DACA recipients after California. \nThree days after Trump announced the administration was phasing out the program, the Arizona attorney general brought a separate lawsuit that claims the state's universities cannot provide in-state tuition rates for DACA recipients. Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the schools are violating Arizona law which makes it clear in-state tuition is eligible only to those with legal immigration status. The schools are vowing to fight back. \nAnd critics of the program were swift to denounce the possibility of a deal in Congress. Numbers USA denounced the prospect of making a deal on border security to provide \"amnesty for the so called 'dreamers' to compete and take jobs from Americans and those here legally.\" \nMeanwhile, immigrants are fearful of being sent back to countries they don't consider home. \nAndrea Aguilera, a Dominican University junior in suburban Chicago, worries about being deported and separated from family members, some of whom are citizens. She was illegally brought across the Mexican border at age 4. \n\"You never know what can happen under this administration. We do want to feel relief. We've been fighting for something more permanent for a really long time,\" she said. \"It seems like it's a game (to political leaders). They don't realize how many peoples' lives are being affected by this.\" \nAt UC Berkeley, Burmese-Taiwanese national Amy Lin, a 23-year-old doctoral student in the university's ethnic studies department, has set up an emergency phone tree for DACA students. She fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials might come knocking. \n\"The university says it doesn't allow ICE agents on campus, but that doesn't mean they won't come in,\" said Lin, who was brought to the U.S. illegally at age 12. \nUniversity of California President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit last Friday that's one of several high-profile legal challenges to Trump's decision. \nNapolitano helped create the program in 2012 as Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama. The 10 schools in the UC system have about 4,000 students without legal permission to stay in the U.S. \nUC schools are among those offering student loans to DACA students, and they've directed campus police not to question or detain individuals based on their immigration status. \nThe University of Illinois at Chicago, which has hundreds of DACA students, has posted online instructions for students and security staff to call campus police immediately if anyone, including federal agents, comes on campus and starts asking questions. \n\"We have to follow the law, obviously,\" said UIC Provost Susan Poser, but \"we're going to do everything we can to support (students).\" \nAt Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, president Elizabeth Kiss plans to invite DACA students to her home to meet with an attorney. Georgia bars in-state tuition rates for students without legal immigration status. \n\"I have no intention of picking a fight with the Georgia Legislature,\" said Kiss. \"I also have to keep students safe and support their well-being.\" \n___ \nTareen contributed to this report from Chicago.

      "text": "VOL. 132 | NO. 184 | Friday, September 15, 2017 Dunavant Confirmed As U.S. Attorney By Bill Dries Message: * Required \nMIKE DUNAVANT \nThe U.S. Senate has confirmed Tipton County prosecutor Mike Dunavant as the new U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, based in Memphis with offices in Jackson, Tennessee. \nDunavant, the elected District Attorney General for the 25th Judicial District, covering Tipton, Fayette, Hardeman, Lauderdale and McNairy Counties, was nominated by President Donald Trump in June on a recommendation from U.S. Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker of Tennessee. \nVeteran federal prosecutor Larry Laurenzi has been acting U.S. Attorney since Ed Stanton resigned to join the Memphis office of the Butler Snow law firm. \nThe Senate vote Thursday, Sept. 14, to confirm Dunavant creates a vacancy for District Attorney General to be filled by Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam. Dunavant was elected to a second eight-year term of office in 2014. \nHe was first elected district attorney general in 2006 after having a private law practice for 11 years, primarily in criminal defense, including death penalty cases. \nA native of Ripley, Tennessee, Dunavant has a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville and earned his law degree at the University of Mississippi. \nU.S. Rep. David Kustoff of Germantown, who is a former U.S. Attorney for the Western District, praised Dunavant’s confirmation. \n“I could not think of a more fitting role for Mike, as he is a lifelong West Tennessean and a proven public servant,” Kustoff said in a written statement. He also praised Laurenzi who has served as acting U.S. Attorney several times during the change in parties occupying the White House. \nStill pending in the Senate are the presidential nominations of state Senate Republican leader Mark Norris and former federal prosecutor Tommy Parker as U.S. District Judges for the Western District. \nThe timing of the Senate vote on Norris will determine whether there will be a special election to fill his state Senate seat. If Norris is confirmed and resigns from the Legislature before Nov. 6, there will be a special election, according to Shelby County Elections Administrator Linda Phillips . If he is confirmed and resigns from the Legislature on Nov. 6 or after, the state Senate seat goes on the ballot during a regularly scheduled election in 2018 with the Shelby County Commission appointing someone to fill the seat until then. \nSign-Up For Our Free Email Edition Get the news first with our daily email Name",

With the International Ice Hockey Federation not allowing any player with an NHL contract to participate, Ovechkin has begrudgingly acknowledged that his Olympic hopes are on hold. \n\"It is still my dream to win an Olympic gold medal for my country,\" Ovechkin said in a statement . \"I hope things will change and all of us will have a chance to go again in 2022.\" \nFive months after the NHL announced it wouldn't be going, most players have moved from anger to acceptance. There is still disappointment and frustration, though Ovechkin made it clear where things stand: \"Now the IIHF and NHL say my country is not allowed to ask anybody in the NHL to play and there is nothing to talk about anymore.\" \nAn IIHF spokesman said he wasn't aware of any official assurances but added: \"We would not permit any player under contract with an NHL team to participate in Pyeongchang without them first obtaining the necessary permissions.\" \nThose permissions aren't coming, and players aren't happy about the opportunity being taken away from them. \n\"It's disappointing,\" said Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid, who would've been a lock to play for Canada if healthy. \"I've never got that chance. I would love to be able to play in Olympics. I've heard that they're real fun.\" \nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said for months that team owners were not interested in putting the season on hold for three weeks to let their players leave for the Olympics. The reluctance was not new, but it was still a surprise in April when the league announced that it would not allow its players to participate. \nChicago Blackhawks winger Patrick Kane won a silver medal with the United States in 2010 and also played in Sochi in 2014 and expects to be cheering that team along this time. \n\"You always relish the opportunity to play for your country, and you don't want to miss too many of those opportunities, especially when it's at the caliber of the Olympics,\" Kane said. \"It would've been fun to go to South Korea and to play in the Olympics. Obviously it's not going to happen.\" \nIt's an especially tough blow for Russian players, many of whom were on the Sochi team that did not win a medal on home ice. Evgeni Malkin recently told Sovietsky Sport that he hoped the Pittsburgh Penguins would let him go to the Olympics, adding of the NHL's decision: \"There's nothing good about this at all.\" \nSt. Louis Blues winger Vladimir Tarasenko, who played alongside Ovechkin and Malkin in Sochi, said players \"get pride playing for their country\" and expressed frustration that executives chose to opt out of the Olympics. \n\"You want something for all your life and then some guys just take it away without obvious reasons,\" Tarasenko said. \"If it's reasons, it's money, but a lot of players want to be there. When I grow up I want to represent my country, especially in Olympic Games.\" \nMcDavid is only 20, Kane 28 and Tarasenko 25, so they should have another opportunity should the NHL return in Beijing. Some expect guaranteeing Olympic participation moving forward to be part of the next round of collective bargaining talks, even though the tournament only affects less than a quarter of the league's players. \n\"Eventually the NHL is going to have us play the Olympics again,\" Swede Nicklas Backstrom said. \"But it is what it is now. We've just got to look forward, and hopefully we can play the next one.\" \nThe next one could be too late for some players, though. \n\"It's unfortunate,\" said Washington's T.J. Oshie, who helped the U.S. beat Russia in the memorable marathon shootout game in Sochi. \"I feel sorry for the people that are in this four-year window that it's not going to be able to happen to them, or it's going to be harder for them to make it in four years.\" \n___ \nFollow Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/SWhyno \n___ \nFor more AP NHL coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Schools seek to help immigrants amid mixed signals on DACA Posted: Updated: Friday,   JOCELYN GECKER and SOPHIA TAREENAssociated Press \nBERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Mixed signals from Washington over a possible agreement to preserve protections for young immigrants are increasing anxiety and confusion on college campuses, where the stakes are high. \nAmid the uncertainty, colleges and universities are stepping up efforts to protect students enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, telling them to be hopeful but plan for the worst. \nHarvard University has opened a round-the-clock emergency hotline for immigrants in the program. The University of Illinois at Chicago has posted advice on what to do if federal agents show up on campus. UC Berkeley, the University of San Francisco and many other campuses are offering free legal advice to immigrant students now facing fears of deportation. Nearly sixty college and university presidents sent a letter urging congressional leaders to make the program permanent out of \"moral imperative and a national necessity.\" \nAn estimated 350,000 of the country's nearly 800,000 DACA recipients are currently enrolled in school, most at colleges or universities, according to a 46-state survey this year by the advocacy group Center for American Progress. Under the program, they were protected from deportation and allowed to legally work in the United States with two-year permits. \nThe top congressional Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, emerged from a White House dinner Wednesday to say they had reached a deal with President Donald Trump to save DACA. But amid backlash from conservative Republicans, Trump said Thursday that they were \"fairly close\" but nothing had been agreed to. \nIt was the latest in a confusing back-and-forth on the subject that started last week when the Trump administration announced it was rescinding the program, but gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix. \n\"I don't think anybody can put much faith in the statement that there is a deal, because so much can change,\" said John Trasvina, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law and an immigration expert who worked in Washington under the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"I've seen tons of times when people think they have an immigration deal, and then it goes away.\" \nUnder the Trump administration plan, those already enrolled in DACA remain covered until their two-year permits expire. If their permits expire before March, 5, 2018, they can renew them for another two years as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the program isn't accepting new applications. \nThe University of San Francisco, which has about 80 DACA recipients, is advising students to adhere to that deadline and is raising money to help pay the $495 renewal fee. \nDespite reassurances from schools that they'll be able to continue attending classes, many students are anxious. They're worried about how they'll pay for school if they can't work. \nAna Maciel, a 23-year-old who works full time to put herself through a University of San Francisco education Master's program, says she's been on \"an emotional roller coaster.\" She fears being deported to Mexico, the country she left at age 3, and wonders if it's smart to keep investing in school if she can't work afterward. \n\"Is this what I should spend my money on?\" Maciel says about her $8,000 tuition. \"Everything is up in the air.\" \nTrump's DACA announcement on Sept. 5 came after 10 Republican attorneys general threatened to sue in an attempt to halt the program. They were led by Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas, which has the second-highest number of DACA recipients after California. \nThree days after Trump announced the administration was phasing out the program, the Arizona attorney general brought a separate lawsuit that claims the state's universities cannot provide in-state tuition rates for DACA recipients. Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the schools are violating Arizona law which makes it clear in-state tuition is eligible only to those with legal immigration status. The schools are vowing to fight back. \nAnd critics of the program were swift to denounce the possibility of a deal in Congress. Numbers USA denounced the prospect of making a deal on border security to provide \"amnesty for the so called 'dreamers' to compete and take jobs from Americans and those here legally.\" \nMeanwhile, immigrants are fearful of being sent back to countries they don't consider home. \nAndrea Aguilera, a Dominican University junior in suburban Chicago, worries about being deported and separated from family members, some of whom are citizens. She was illegally brought across the Mexican border at age 4. \n\"You never know what can happen under this administration. We do want to feel relief. We've been fighting for something more permanent for a really long time,\" she said. \"It seems like it's a game (to political leaders). They don't realize how many peoples' lives are being affected by this.\" \nAt UC Berkeley, Burmese-Taiwanese national Amy Lin, a 23-year-old doctoral student in the university's ethnic studies department, has set up an emergency phone tree for DACA students. She fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials might come knocking. \n\"The university says it doesn't allow ICE agents on campus, but that doesn't mean they won't come in,\" said Lin, who was brought to the U.S. illegally at age 12. \nUniversity of California President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit last Friday that's one of several high-profile legal challenges to Trump's decision. \nNapolitano helped create the program in 2012 as Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama. The 10 schools in the UC system have about 4,000 students without legal permission to stay in the U.S. \nUC schools are among those offering student loans to DACA students, and they've directed campus police not to question or detain individuals based on their immigration status. \nThe University of Illinois at Chicago, which has hundreds of DACA students, has posted online instructions for students and security staff to call campus police immediately if anyone, including federal agents, comes on campus and starts asking questions. \n\"We have to follow the law, obviously,\" said UIC Provost Susan Poser, but \"we're going to do everything we can to support (students).\" \nAt Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, president Elizabeth Kiss plans to invite DACA students to her home to meet with an attorney. Georgia bars in-state tuition rates for students without legal immigration status. \n\"I have no intention of picking a fight with the Georgia Legislature,\" said Kiss. \"I also have to keep students safe and support their well-being.\" \n___ \nTareen contributed to this report from Chicago.

RUSSOAP College Football Writer \nLamar Jackson basically had the Heisman Trophy wrapped up last season by Oct. 2, playing so well in Louisville's biggest games early in the season that a few stumbles late didn't cost him. \nRepeating will be difficult. Only one college football player has won the Heisman twice. But if Jackson does make a serious run at joining Ohio State's Archie Griffin as a two-time Heisman winner, he will again have to make a lasting impression early. \nThe No. 14 Louisville hosts No. 3 Clemson on Saturday night, with a chance for both Jackson and the Cardinals to make an early season statement, just as they did last year. \nOtherwise, the third weekend of the season is light on big matchups, but ripe for a few upsets with six ranked teams playing on the road against unranked teams. \nThings to watch for during one of the weekends when things could get weird. \nBEST GAME \nNo. 3 Clemson at No. 14 Louisville. \nThe Tigers are coming off a dominant defensive performance against Auburn at home that included 11 sacks. \nSeems like an obvious key to the game. Louisville's offensive line struggles to protect Jackson. Clemson's defensive line has a bunch of future early round NFL draft picks, such as Dexter Lawrence and Christian Wilkins. \nDon't forget the other side of the ball, though. Last season Clemson had Deshaun Watson to counter Jackson's brilliance in a 42-36 Tigers' victory. If Jackson goes off again, can new Clemson quarterback Kelly Bryant keep up? \nHEISMAN WATCH \nYes, Jackson, but anybody else? \nHow about Josh Rosen? The UCLA quarterback is off to a remarkable start that includes one of the great comebacks in college football history against Texas A&M in Week 1. The Bruins play a potentially tricky game against Memphis on Saturday that kicks off at 11 a.m. locally, but 9 a.m. PT. It's the type of game that screams trap. If Rosen can help UCLA avoid it, he'll enter Pac-12 play with some real Heisman buzz. \nNUMBERS TO KNOW \n2003 - The last time Tennessee beat Florida at the Swamp. Also the last time the Vols won in consecutive years against the Gators. No. 23 Tennessee tries to end both droughts Saturday in Gainesville against No. 24 Florida. \n17 - Yards passing for Army (2-0) this season in victories against Fordham and Buffalo. The Black Knights are second in the nation in rushing at 417 yards per game, but the competition gets much tougher Saturday when they visit No. 8 Ohio State. \n6-0 - Tom Herman's record against ranked opponents in two seasons coaching Houston. Herman and Texas face No. 4 Southern California at a sold-out Los Angeles Coliseum. \n4x100 - Stanford running back Bryce Love is the first Cardinal player to run for at least 100 yards in his first four career starts. The 19th-ranked Cardinals play at San Diego State, which just knocked off Arizona State of the Pac-12 last week. \nUNDER THE RADAR \nA game that is not getting a ton of attention nationally from fans and media, but certainly is from NFL scouts is Oregon at Wyoming. \nRepresentatives from more than 20 NFL teams will be in Laramie on Saturday to see quarterback Josh Allen face a Power Five team for the last time this regular season. Allen is a big-time prospect, but still raw. \nHe had a blah game to start the season against Iowa, but now he's at home and Oregon's defense is still fairly accommodating. It's a chance for Allen to put up some big numbers. The quarterback on the other side will draw attention, too. Ducks sophomore Justin Herbert might be another future first-rounder, though he can't go pro until 2019. \nHOT SEAT WATCH \nArizona State coach Todd Graham came into this season in need of a turnaround after two straight losing years. Early signs are not good after the Sun Devils were roughed up at home last week by San Diego State. \nNow they go to Lubbock, Texas, for the return match of a wild game with Texas Tech last season. The teams combined for 123 points in an Arizona State victory. Another loss would leave Arizona State at 1-2 heading into Pac-12, where its first seven games are: Oregon, at Stanford, Washington, at Utah, USC, Colorado and at UCLA. \n___ \nFollow Ralph D.

More >> Updated: Friday, September 15 2017 8:32 PM EDT 2017-09-16 00:32:29   By DOUG FERGUSONAP Golf Writer \nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) - Phil Mickelson was reminded of happier times he shared with Keegan Bradley. \nEarlier this year at the Memorial, as Mickelson was waiting for the fairway to clear on the par-5 15th hole at Muirfield Village, he told a story from the Presidents Cup in 2013, back when he and Bradley were regular partners in team competitions. \nIt was during foursomes on the second day of the matches that Mickelson and Bradley played some of their best golf. They shot 30 in alternate shot on the front nine. They were 6 up with six holes to play against Jason Day and Graham DeLaet. But then Bradley missed a short putt on the 13th to close out the match, and he missed another putt to end it on the 14th. Mickelson had seen enough. \nOn the par-5 15th, DeLaet had about 8 feet for birdie. Bradley had 4 feet for birdie. That's when Mickelson stepped in and conceded DeLaet's putt. Bradley looked at his partner as if he had lost his mind. Mickelson told Bradley that it was time to end the match, and Bradley followed orders. \nMickelson about doubled over telling the story this year. \nHe has served as somewhat of a mentor since Bradley's amazing rookie season in 2011, when he won the PGA Championship in the first major he ever played. They were undefeated in team matches a year later at the Ryder Cup. Five years ago, they both were among the top 10 in the world ranking. \nNow they share something else in common. \nEach has gone more than four years without winning. Both are outside the top 30 in the FedEx Cup going into the BMW Championship, needing a good week at Conway Farms to have any chance to reaching the FedEx Cup finale at the Tour Championship. \nThat's one reason Mickelson sent Bradley a text on the eve of the opening round. \n\"We all go through highs and lows in this game,\" Mickelson said. \"He and I have been on a stretch where we are not playing at our best and we are close to getting it back. I can see in it his game, I can feel in it my game and I really enjoy playing on the events with him. ... And I just sent him a little text. 'Hey, let's have a special week, we're close, we're playing well, let's put it together this week.' \n\"Because his upside - his potential as a player - is as high as just about anybody.\" \nThe opening round Thursday at the BMW Championship was but a small step. \nBradley birdied his opening three holes on his way to a 65. Mickelson played bogey-free for a 66. \nMickelson believes he has found a cure for losing focus and energy during a round, much of that attributed to his psoriatic arthritis. He won't go into details on what changed, hinting only at diet and some medication. He finished sixth two weeks ago. Every week, he looks better. \nMickelson's text message was meaningful to Bradley, along with other words of encouragement he has received during this slump from the likes of Ernie Els. Bradley dropped as low as No. 120 in the world this summer, and now is barely inside the top 100. \nWhat really stung was in April, when he was home watching the Masters on TV for the first time since his rookie season. His five-year exemption from winning the PGA Championship had expired. \n\"It stinks. It's no fun. No fun watching majors at home, no fun watching Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups at home,\" Bradley said. \"You start feeling bad for yourself. You've got to put more effort in, work harder and practice harder and play more, and hopefully it will pay off. \n\"It's motivation to play better,\" he said. \"Only I can fix that.\" \nBradley has a long way to go. He likely needs to finish in the top five to have any chance of getting to the Tour Championship. If he can get to Atlanta, he would be assured of getting in all four majors next year. \"You're basically top 50 in the world,\" Bradley said. \nHe also has a baby due in November. \nPerhaps more importantly, Bradley has motivation again. For years, he played as though he had something to prove. He wasn't recruited to top colleges, instead playing at St. John's. He kicked around in the minor leagues and worked his way up to the PGA Tour while hearing plenty of doubters along the way. \nBut after winning three times - including a major and a World Golf Championship - in his first two years, he began a slow slide. \nThe motivation now? \n\"Everyone thinks I stink. You should read my Twitter feed,\" he said. \"I look forward to coming out every day and proving people wrong. ... Things are different now. I have a lot to work for, a lot more years out here. And I look forward to that.\" Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

More >> Updated: Friday, September 15 2017 8:32 PM EDT 2017-09-16 00:32:29   By JOE KAYAP Sports Writer \nCINCINNATI (AP) - A black tux and bowtie. Deshaun Watson decided to dress in style for his first NFL start, one that came in prime time on his 22nd birthday. \nThe clothes and the moment were a perfect fit for the national champ. \nWatson scrambled 49 yards for the game's only touchdown Thursday night, leading the injury-depleted Houston Texans to a 13-9 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. He avoided the big mistake, made the game-turning play, and led Houston (1-1) to a clinching field goal in the closing minutes. \n\"It was insane,\" defensive end Christian Covington said of the rookie's touchdown run . \"That's why he is who he is. The whole sideline went crazy. That was a game-sealing touchdown right there.\" \nIt came in the first half, but given the way the Bengals are playing on offense, it was indeed the decisive play. Cincinnati (0-2) opened the season with a pair of home games, but has yet to score a touchdown in 25 possessions. \nThe last team that opened with two home games and failed to reach the end zone was the 1939 Eagles, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. No team has scored so few points in a pair of season-opening home games since the 1949 Packers. \n\"I am shocked,\" coach Marvin Lewis said. \"Yes, I am. We should be better.\" \nFew young quarterbacks have gotten better results than Watson, who was working with an offense missing three tight ends to concussions, plus a receiver and a guard. He ran five times for a team-high 67 yards and completed 15 of 24 passes for 125 yards with no interceptions and three sacks. \nWatson won a national championship at Clemson with his dual-threat ability. The first-round pick used every bit of it in a conservative plan aimed at making the most of what the Texans had left on offense. \n\"I don't really get nervous when I step on the field,\" Watson said. \"Football is football. This is what I've been dreaming of my whole life.\" \nSome takeaways from the Texans' win: \nWATSON'S PLAUDITS: Watson is the first rookie quarterback to win his first start on the road in a prime-time game since the Eagles' Joe Webb in 2010, according to Elias. He's the first quarterback in the last two seasons to lead his team in both passing and rushing and get a win. \n\"That's one of the things you've seen throughout his career at Clemson, and what we've seen in the preseason here,\" coach Bill O'Brien said. \"He just has that ability and that knack.\" \nWATT BACK IN FORM: J.J. Watt raised more than $30 million for those affected when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas. He was emotional in the Texans' home opener Sunday and managed only one tackle and one quarterback hit. He was back in form Thursday with six tackles, one pass deflection and one hit on Dalton. He also leveled center Russell Bodine on the game's final play after he got a lateral. \n\"Zig-zag, zig-zag, zig-zag, tired, tired, tired,\" Watt said, describing the multi-lateral play. \"Thank you for throwing it to the guy closest to me - body slam.\" \nMORE TEXANS INJURIES \nHouston starting cornerbacks Johnathan Joseph (right shoulder) and Kevin Johnson (left knee) were hurt in the second half and didn't return, adding to the Texans' mounting injury woes. Linebacker Brian Cushing is serving a 10-game suspension for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. \nDALTON'S STRUGGLES: Andy Dalton threw four interceptions , lost a fumble and finished with a passer rating of 28.4 in a 20-0 loss to the Ravens on Sunday, the first time the Bengals were blanked in a home opener. He was under heavy pressure again Thursday while going 20 of 35 for 224 yards with three sacks and a passer rating of 76.4. He has struggled against the Texans, his hometown team - he grew up in suburban Katy. Dalton is 1-6 career against Houston, including a pair of first-round playoff losses. He's thrown three touchdowns and seven interceptions. \nCHANGES NEEDED: Receiver A.J. Green insisted that the Bengals need to do a better job getting the ball to their playmakers in the crucial moments. The offense slipped last season with Ken Zampese in his first season as coordinator, with injuries gutting the unit at midseason. They've been fully healthy during the horrid 0-2 start. \nAsked if changes are ahead, Lewis said, \"We're not going to talk about that right now.\" \n___ \nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Digital Replica Edition President Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017, after meeting with people impacted by Hurricane Irma in Florida. Andrew Harnik AP Photo President Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017, after meeting with people impacted by Hurricane Irma in Florida. Andrew Harnik AP Photo Trump tests loyal base with immigration flirtation with Dems By JULIE PACE and STEVE PEOPLES Associated Press September 15, 2017 2:04 AM WASHINGTON \nFew issues have animated President Donald Trump's ardent supporters more than his pledge to build a wall along the nation's Southern border. Now, Trump's decision to put that promise aside — at least temporarily — while he pursues a deal with Democrats to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally may test the limits of that loyalty. \nSome avid Trump backers praised the president as a pragmatist trying to make deals with whomever he can. But others recoiled at the prospect of Trump joining forces with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on immigration, and seeming to get little in return. \n\"Many supporters of the president wonder whether our king has been captured and (White House chief of staff John) Kelly and a clique of generals and their globalist friends are now governing,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to Trump. His comments reflected the growing concern among some Trump backers about the diminished presence of nationalist advisers in the West Wing. \nAmy Kremer, who founded the group Women Vote Trump, likened the president's deal-making with Democrats to one of history's most notorious political flip-flops: President George H.W. Bush's broken campaign-trail vow that he wouldn't raise taxes. \n\"If the wall doesn't get done and he gives amnesty, he'll lose the base,\" Kremer said. \"You're going to see an absolute revolt.\" \nThe worries were sparked by Trump's startling efforts to forge consensus with Schumer and Pelosi — \"Chuck and Nancy,\" as the president has cozily referred to the Democratic duo — over the fate of nearly 800,000 people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump, Schumer and Pelosi discussed the matter at a private White House dinner Wednesday night. \nOn Thursday morning, the president — a former Democrat himself — and the minority leaders appeared largely aligned. Trump said an agreement to allow the young immigrants to stay in the country would have to include \"massive border security.\" But he pointedly said a border wall, which is staunchly opposed by Democrats, could come later. He's outlined no specific path for ultimately making that happen. \nWhile allowing young people who came to the U.S. illegally to stay in the country is broadly popular, immigration hardliners consider it amnesty. As a candidate, Trump vowed to repeal the executive action signed by President Barack Obama allowing the young people to stay. But he's struggled with the issue as president, often speaking sympathetically about the young immigrants. Earlier this month, he announced that he would rescind their protections in March, but said he wanted Congress to pass legislation protecting them from deportation. \nTrump has tested the limits of his supporters' loyalty before, often to find that they were unshaken by his policy reversals. He failed to fulfill his pledge to repeal Obama's signature health care law. He's backed off his tough talk on China, declining to label Beijing a currency manipulator. The United States is still a party to the Iran nuclear deal, despite Trump's promise to rip up the agreement. \nBut immigration, and the border wall in particular, hold special resonance with Trump supporters. Some of Trump's appeal to the white, working-class voters who formed the basis of his voting bloc stemmed from his promises to crack down on illegal immigration. At his raucous campaign rallies, voters often broke out into chants of \"build that wall.\" \nOnce in the White House, Trump's nationalist-minded advisers, particularly strategist Steve Bannon, often pressed the president on the particular importance of fulfilling his promise on the border wall. But Bannon, who kept a tally of Trump's campaign promises in his West Wing office, was pushed out this summer as part of Kelly's takeover of the White House. \nThe headlines Thursday on Breitbart News, where Bannon returned after leaving the administration, were unforgiving. One panned the president as \"Amnesty Don.\" Another said Trump got \"rolled\" by the Democrats. \nWith his poll numbers sagging, Trump has spent recent weeks alternating between being deeply worried about disappointing his base and deeply frustrated with Republican lawmakers' struggles to pass significant legislation. The GOP's failure to pass an Obamacare overhaul in particular soured Trump's view of Republican congressional leaders, according to advisers, and opened him up to the prospect of partnering with Democrats instead. \nSome of Trump's supporters praised the president for what they see as pragmatism. \n\"He's to the point he needs to get something done. The Republican Party has failed him miserably,\" said Jeff Jorgensen, the GOP chairman in western Iowa's conservative Pottawattamie County. \"Hats off to him. If you need to cross the aisle to get things done, then cross the aisle.\" \nThere's no guarantee that the common ground Trump found this week with Democrats on immigration will result in legislation. Republicans still control which legislation comes up for votes, and neither Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell nor House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared eager to sign on. The scope of the border security measures that would be included in an eventual bill could also undercut Democratic support. \nTrump, trying to tamp down criticism that he was acquiescing to his political opponents, insisted he would eventually make good on his promises to his base. \n\"Ultimately, we have to have the wall,\" he said. \"If we don't get the wall we're not doing anything.\" \n___ \nPeoples reported from New York.

      "text": "A man at a railway station in Seoul walks past a screen showing a news graphic of a North Korean missile launch on Sept. 15, 2017. (Photo by AFP)\nNorth Korea has fired yet another missile over Japan, Japanese and Korean media say, a few hours after Pyongyang threatened to \"sink\" its south eastern neighbor. \nThe missile launch from Pyongyang on early Friday prompted officials to ask people in the Japanese island of Hokkaido to take shelter, local media reported.\nThe missile flew for about 20 minutes before crashing into the Pacific Ocean about 2,000 kilometers east of Hokkaido at around 7 am local time, the Japanese state broadcaster NHK reported, citing government officials.\n“North Korea fired an unidentified missile eastward from the vicinity of Pyongyang this morning,” the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The unknown missile reached an altitude of 770 km and covered a distance of 3,700 km during its flight, according to the South Korean military.\n\n\n\nThe South’s military officials said they were working with their American counterparts to analyze the details of the launch.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe both called their ministers to hold urgent national security council meetings following the launch.\nAbe said Japan will \"never tolerate\" what he described as North Korea's \"dangerous provocative action that threatens world peace.\"\nMoon said the new move by Pyongyang would only lead to further diplomatic and economic isolation.\n\"President Moon ordered officials to closely analyze and prepare for new possible North Korean threats like EMP (electro-magnetic pulse) and biochemical attacks,\" Moon's spokesman Park Su-hyun told reporters.\nThe Japanese government's alert message called J-alert notifying citizens of a ballistic missile launch by North Korea is seen on a TV screen in Tokyo, Japan, on September 15, 2017. (Photo by Reuters)\nAccording to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency, the country’s military forces also conducted a ballistic missile drill in the Japan Sea, known as the East Sea, in response to the missile alert.\nWashington reacts \nThe Pentagon confirmed the launch and said the projectile was an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM).\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the launch was “provocative” and the threats against Japan would only “deepen North Korea’s diplomatic and economic isolation.”  \nPyongyang had threatened to “sink” Japan earlier on Thursday, saying the country \"no longer needed to exist near us.\" The move came less than three weeks after the North fired another missile over Japanese territories.\nUnsettled by the move in late August, Abe called on US President Donald Trump and other Western leaders to increase pressure on Pyongyang in order to stop its development of ballistic missiles.\n\n\nThe pressure peaked in early September, when the North announced that it had successfully exploded a hydrogen bomb, its sixth overall thermonuclear test.\nThe United Nation Security Council adopted new sanctions against the North as a result, a move that Pyongyang warned would not go unanswered.\n\nEmergency UN Security Council meeting \nMeanwhile, UN diplomats said the UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 3 pm (1900 GMT) on Friday concerning North Korea's latest missile launch over Japan. The session, which will be held behind closed doors, was requested by the US and Japan",

      "text": "0 \nTOKYO: Japan's defence minister said Friday he believed North Korea \"has Guam in mind\" after its most recent missile launch, noting it had sufficient range to hit the US territory. Pyongyang has threatened to hit the US Pacific territory with \"enveloping fire,\" sparking dire warnings from US President Donald Trump. Itsunori Onodera told reporters that Friday's missile, which overflew Japanese territory, flew 3,700 kilometres -- \"long enough to cover Guam\", which is 3,400 kilometres (2,100 miles) from North Korea. \"We cannot assume North Korea's intention, but given what it has said, I think it has Guam in mind,\" Onodera said. He warned that \"similar actions (by the North) would continue\" as Pyongyang appeared to have shrugged off UN sanctions agreed earlier this week. The US Pacific Command confirmed the launch was an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) but said it posed no threat to Guam or to the American mainland. But, for the second time in less than a month, it overflew Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido, sparking loudspeaker alerts and warnings to citizens to take cover. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Tokyo could \"never tolerate\" what he called a \"dangerous provocative action that threatens world peace\". Copyright AFP (Agence France-Press), 2017 ",

It was great to be at the launch event to get our hands on the phones to hear more about, and see, the key features that really make them unique. \nSome of the key features we got to see in more detail were: \nhttps://medium.com/media/c7eff65ed8de69afd244cc9f16968143/href \nBuilt using know how from Sony’s Cyber Shot range, the Motion Eye Camera really allows you to capture stunning images. \nhttps://medium.com/media/5417c8041b271e524c7ce8296258d029/href \nBoth phones also allow videos to be captured in super slow motion at 960 frames per second and feature predictive capture and auto-focus burst to allow you capture moments not possible with other smartphones. Sony Xperia XZ1 Display \nContinuing to enhance their smartphones with technological know how from their other products, the display on the Xperia XZ1 devices uses Sony’s BRAVIA TV technology to bring more colour and contrast to TV shows and movies in stunning realism, by incorporating HDR (High Dynamic Range) in its 5.2” full HD display, thus bringing razor-sharp, detailed and brighter images on screen. \nhttps://medium.com/media/d84f7dff24d5f545da1577e94689f153/href \nThe most interesting aspect of these phones comes in the form of the 3D creator. This allows you to scan your face to use in the Augmented Reality feature or chat on social media with a 3D sticker. There’s a full head scan option that let’s you share with friends or order a 3D printed version of yourself (if you’re that vain). While not a fan myself you can 3D scan your food and share it on social media, but please don’t. Related with Acer Announces The GX Series Gaming Desktops \nThe Augmented Reality was also a really fun feature on the Xperia’s. There are so much possibilities with integration into Playstation games for example. Just imagine you playing for your favorite football team in Fifa or causing havoc in GTA. It could also be used in mobile applications, we were shown a demo of iron man with one of the Sony team’s face and I can see this type of technology being a big hit with kids. It’s this innovation that I found refreshing and something I haven’t seen on other smartphones previously. \nConor MacCormack CEO and creator of MCor Technologies, an Irish 3D printing company, was also present to talk about the possibilities and the simplicity for ordering 3D printed objects from your phone. Some of the props on display were of Hillary Clinton, a Nike shoe, a hammer and an unnervingly accurate Donald Trump. \nThe Xperia XZ1 will be available from mid-September in Black and Moonlit Blue for €650 sim free. They will also be available on contract at a range of different price points depending on the provider. \nThe Xperia XZ1 Compact will be available from October for €550 sim free. They will also be available on contract at a range of different price points depending on the provider. Colour variations will be revealed in the coming weeks. \nWe will be reviewing both smartphones in the very near future, but in the meantime, be sure to drop into your local store to check them out when they do go on sale. \nSony also announced a number of new products at IFA 2017 earlier this month in Berlin. If you’re interested here’s all the products announced. They include the new Bravia OLED A1 Series TV, a premium range A9 camera, the RX0 Compact Camera, three sets of wireless headphones; the WF-1000X, the WH-1000XM2 and the WI-1000X. Also announced was Sony’s LF-S50G, which is their Google assisted wireless smart speaker. \nYou can hear all about these new products by watching the Key Note speech from the event. \nhttps://medium.com/media/9a61beb2ee8fb81a400061ff9bf53857/href \nSony Xperia Launch Event 2017 was originally published in Ireland’s Technology Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "text": "0 \nWASHINGTON: Donald Trump signed into law a Congressional resolution condemning white supremacists on Thursday, after lawmakers maneuvered the president into backing a text triggered by his equivocal response to racial violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump signed the resolution \"rejecting White nationalists, White supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and other hate groups,\" which was unanimously passed by Congress earlier in the week. The overwhelming passage of the text meant that Trump would have likely had any attempted presidential veto overturned. In a statement, Trump said he was \"pleased to sign\" the measure, adding that \"as Americans, we condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms.\" Lawmakers from Virginia said Congress spoke with \"a unified voice\" to unequivocally condemn the August unrest, in which a rally by far-right extremists turned violent and a counter-demonstrator was killed when a car driven by a suspected white supremacist plowed into a crowd. Trump was widely criticized for suggesting \"both sides\" shared blame for the violence between white supremacist groups and those opposed to them. The president's job approval ratings sank to one of the lowest levels of his turbulent seven-month presidency, as he was savaged -- including within his own camp -- over his handling of the fallout from Charlottesville. - 'Pretty bad dudes' - Trump earlier on Thursday had revived his much-criticized suggestion of an equivalence between counter-protestors and those who killed Heather Heyer. \"I think especially in light of the advent of Antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also,\" Trump said, using a common name for anti-fascist groups which have sprung up in opposition to a resurgent white nationalist movement. \"Now because of what's happened since then, with Antifa, you look at, you know, really what's happened since Charlottesville -- a lot of people are saying -- in fact a lot of people have actually written, 'gee Trump might have a point.'\" \"I said, you got some very bad people on the other side also, which is true.\" Trump's latest remarks sparked another round of controversy, amid a heated about the role of race in US politics. Trump ran for the White House on a strongly anti-immigrant platform and before becoming president repeatedly and falsely questioned whether ex-president Barack Obama was born in the United States. While overt racism is rare in most parts of the United States, a significant minority of Americans express racially-charged ideas. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 70 percent of Americans strongly agreed that people of different races should be \"free to live wherever they choose\" and that \"all races are equal.\" But 31 percent of respondents \"strongly or somewhat agreed\" that the United States needs to \"protect and preserve its White European heritage.\" \"There are nearly 250 million adults in the United States, so even small percentages likely represent the beliefs of many millions of Americans,\" said Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

      "text": "At least 29 injured in London train bomb-fire; authorities raise threat level, hunt suspects By AFP   Members of the emergency services and armed police officers work outside Parsons Green underground tube station in west London - AFP Members of the emergency services work near Parsons Green underground tube station in west London - AFP A armed British police officer walks through the carriage of a London underground tube carriage at Parsons Green underground tube station in west London - AFP An injured woman is led away after an incident at Parsons Green underground station in London - Reuters Armed police officers walk through a carriage of a London underground tube train at Parsons Green station in London - Reuters Police officers stand on the road near Parsons Green tube station in London - Reuters \nLONDON: A home-made bomb on a packed rush-hour commuter train in London engulfed a carriage in flames and injured 29 people on Friday, but apparently failed to fully explode, in Britain’s fifth major terrorism incident this year. Passengers heading into the British capital fled in panic after the blast as the train was about to depart Parsons Green station in West London at 8:20 AM (12:20 PM PST) . \nSome suffered burns and others were injured in a stampede to escape the station — one of the above-ground stops on the underground “Tube” network — but health officials said none were thought to be in a serious condition. “We are chasing down suspects,” said Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Mark Rowley. “Somebody has planted this improvised explosive device on the Tube: we have to be open-minded at this stage about him and about potential associates.” Threat level upped to 'critical' \nHundreds of detectives and intelligence officials were involved in the manhunt. Rowley declined to say if the suspected bomber had been on the train. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan slammed the terrorist act, saying, \"I utterly condemn the hideous individuals who target innocent people and attempt to use terror to harm us and destroy our way of life.\" \nKhan asked people to \"remain vigilant\" and informed Londoners that he \"attended the COBRA security meeting this afternoon\" in order to stay updated on \"the response and investigation\". \nPrime Minister Theresa May returned to London to chair a meeting of the government’s emergency response committee. She called the incident a “cowardly attack” and said the national threat level had been raised a notch to its highest level, “critical”. \nDaesh — which has said it was behind several attacks on Western cities in recent years, including two attacks in London and one in Manchester this year — claimed responsibility through its news agency, Amaq. \nIt was impossible to verify the claim, for which Amaq offered no evidence. Western intelligence officials have questioned similar claims in the past, saying that while Daesh's extremist ideology may have inspired some attackers, there is scant evidence that it has orchestrated attacks. Deputy Chief Constable Adrian Hanstock of the British Transport Police makes a statement to the media after an incident at Parsons Green underground station in London, Britain, September 15, 2017. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor “It is very routine in these sort of circumstances for IS to claim responsibility, whether or not they have had any previous engagement with the individuals involved,” Rowley said. 'I saw this fireball' \nPictures taken at the scene showed a slightly charred white bucket with a supermarket freezer bag on the floor of one train carriage. The bucket, still intact, was in flames and there appeared to be wires coming out of the top. \n“I was on second carriage from the back. I just heard a kind of ‘whoosh’. I looked up and saw the whole carriage engulfed in flames making its way towards me,” Ola Fayankinnu — who was on the train — told Reuters. \n“There were phones, hats, bags all over the place and when I looked back I saw a bag with flames.” \nTwitter user @Rrigs — who posted pictures of a white bucket smouldering on the train — said, \"Explosion on Parsons Green district line train. Fireball flew down carriage and we just jumped out open door.\" \nThe bucket looked like the type used by builders and there appeared to be cables coming out of it. Personal belongings and a bucket with an item on fire inside it are seen on the floor of an underground train carriage at Parsons Green station in West London, Britain, September 15, 2017, in this image taken from social media. Sylvain Pennec via REUTERS Charlie Craven — another witness — said he had just got on the train when the device exploded. \n“Literally within three seconds of putting your bag down, the doors just closing, we hear a loud explosion,” he told Reuters. “I looked around and saw this massive fireball… coming down the carriage.” \nCraven said terrified passengers fled, fearing a second explosion or a gunman, with people being knocked to the ground and crushed in the stampede to escape. \nOutside the station, a woman was carried off on a stretcher with her legs covered in a foil blanket, while others were led away swathed in bandages. The health service said 29 people had been treated in hospital, many suffering from flash burns. In 2005, 52 people were killed when four British extremists carried out suicide bomb attacks on three London underground trains and a bus, and this year Britain has suffered four attacks that killed a total of 36 people. \n“Another attack in London by a loser terrorist,” US President Donald Trump said on Twitter. “These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!” \nHis comment that the suspect was known to London police carried echoes of the Manchester attack in May when British police were infuriated by US authorities leaking details of the investigation, including the name of the main suspect, to media. \nAsked about Trump’s tweet, May said, “I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation.” 'So unhelpful' \nOthers were more directly critical of Trump. “True or not - and I‘m sure he doesn’t know - this is so unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner,” May’s former chief of staff Nick Timothy tweeted. \nA US law enforcement official and a US intelligence source — speaking on condition of anonymity — said the attack might have been carried out in response to recent Daesh video messages urging would-be militants to attack trains and other public transport. \nOne of the officials said the device’s rudimentary design suggested the attack had not been carried out by a trained cell. \nProfessor Hans Michels — an explosives expert from Imperial College London — said the device appeared to have largely failed. \n“The flash flame reported suggests that the ‘explosion’ was only partly successful,” he said. “I must speculate that either the mixture was not of the right composition or that the ignition system was inadequate or not properly placed.” 'Will never be intimidated' \nUK security services believe those behind some of the militant incidents in Britain this year were probably acting alone, radicalised by online material. \nThe London mayor urged people to stay cautious and explained that \"tonight and this weekend there will be additional police officers – including armed officers – on our streets to keep us safe\". \"We will never let those who seek to divide us win – we will never be intimidated or defeated by terrorism,\" Khan added. Prior incidents of terrorism \nIn March, a man drove a car into pedestrians on London’s Westminster Bridge, killing four, before he stabbed a policeman to death outside parliament. \nA further 22 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester in May and the following month, three extremists drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people at nearby restaurants and bars, killing eight. \nIn June, a van was driven into worshippers near a mosque in north London, which left one man dead. \nFigures released on Thursday showed there had been a record number of terrorism-related arrests in Britain in the past year. \nIn the three years to March this year, police foiled 13 potential attacks, Rowley said this week. But the next 17 weeks saw the four attacks in London and Manchester, while the authorities thwarted six others. Advertisement",

      "text": "  3:57 PM EDT Sep 15, 2017 UK terror level 'critical,' manhunt on after bomb wounds 29 on London subway Share   3:57 PM EDT Sep 15, 2017 By Jill Lawless LONDON — \nA homemade bomb planted in a rush-hour subway car injured 29 people in London on Friday, sparking a huge manhunt for the perpetrators of what police said was the fourth terrorist attack in the British capital this year. \nUK officials have also raised the country's terrorism threat level to \"critical\" —meaning another attack is expected shortly. Advertisement \nPrime Minister Theresa May said the device “was intended to cause significant harm,” but to the relief of authorities and Londoners, the bomb — hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag — only partially exploded, sparing the city much worse carnage. \n“I would say this was a failed high-explosive device,” Chris Hunter, a former British army bomb expert, said of the blast, which caused no serious injuries. \nThe bomb went off around 8:20 a.m. as the train, carrying commuters from the suburbs — including many school children — was at Parsons Green station in the southwest of the city. \nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw “out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train,” followed by “an acrid chemical smell.” \nCommuter Lauren Hubbard said she was on the train when she heard a loud bang.“I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming toward us,” Hubbard said. She said her instinct was “just run,” and she fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend. \nChaos ensued as hundreds of people, some of them suffering burns, poured from the train, which can hold up to 800 people. \n“I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying. There were little kids clinging onto the back of me,” said another commuter, Ryan Barnett. \nPassenger Luke Walmsley said it was “like every man for himself to get down the stairs.” \n“People were just pushing,” he added. “There were nannies or mums asking where their children were.” \nPolice and health officials said 29 people were treated in London hospitals, most of them for flash burns. None of the injuries were serious or life-threatening, the emergency services said. \nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the Underground’s District Line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter (150-foot) cordon around the scene while they secured the device and launched a search for those who planted it. \nThe Metropolitan Police said hundreds of detectives, along with agents of the domestic spy agency MI5, were looking at surveillance camera footage, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. \nAmong questions they were rushing to answer: What was the device made from, and was it meant to go off when it did, in a leafy, affluent part of the city far from London’s top tourist sites? \nBritish media reported that the bomb included a timer. Lewis Herrington, a terrorism expert at Loughborough University, said that would set it apart from suicide attacks like those on the London subway in 2005 or at Manchester Arena in May, in which the attackers “all wanted to die.” \nPhotos taken inside the train showed a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag, with flames and what appeared to be wires emerging from the top. \nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that from the photos it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact. \n“They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse,” he said. \nHunter, the explosives expert, said it appeared that “there was a bang, a bit of a flash, and that would suggest that, potentially, some of the explosive detonated, the detonator detonated, but much of the explosive was effectively inert.” \nPolice and ambulances were on the scene within minutes of the blast, a testament to their experience at responding to violent attacks in London. The city has been a target for decades: from Irish Republican Army bombers, right-wing extremists and, more recently, attackers inspired by al-Qaida or the Islamic State group. \nIn its recent Inspire magazine, al-Qaida urged supporters to target trains. \nBritain has seen four other terrorist attacks this year, which killed a total of 36 people. The other attacks in London — near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London — used vehicles and knives. Similar methods have been used in attacks across Europe, including in Nice, Stockholm, Berlin and Barcelona. \nIn contrast Friday’s attack involved the “detonation of an improvised explosive device,” said Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police. \nAfter chairing a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee, the prime minister said that Britain’s official threat level from terrorism remained at “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely, and was not being raised to critical. \nThe country’s threat level was briefly raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, after the May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people. \nBritish authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since the van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. Police and MI5 say that at any given time they are running about 500 counterterrorism investigations involving 3,000 individuals. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been a “shift” in the terrorism threat, with attackers using a wide range of methods to try to inflict carnage. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, said London police needed more resources to fight the threat. Police budgets have been cut since 2010 by Britain’s Conservative government. \nThe London Underground, which handles 5 million journeys a day, has been targeted several times in the past. In July 2005, suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode. \nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode. \nU.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Friday’s attack, tweeting that it was carried out “by a loser terrorist,” and adding that “these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.” \nThe British prime minister gently rebuked the president for his tweets. \n“I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” May said.___ Gregory Katz in London and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.",

      "text": "By ERICA WERNER and JILL COLVIN   answers a question from the media as he arrives at the White House, Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017, in Washington. Trump is returning from Florida after viewing damage from Hurricane Irma. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) \nPosted: 3:09   \nThe fate of 800,000 young immigrants hung in the balance as top lawmakers, White House officials and President Donald Trump himself squabbled over whether an agreement had been struck to protect them — and if so, exactly what it was. \nIn the face of an intense backlash from conservatives inside the Capitol and out, Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP House members adamantly insisted that there was no agreement to enshrine protections for the immigrants brought to America as children and now here illegally. \nJohn Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, put it this way: There was \"a deal to make a deal.\" \nTrump himself said he was \"fairly close\" to an agreement that could protect the young \"Dreamers\" while also adding border security, as long as his long-promised wall with Mexico was also separately addressed. Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer — whose dinner with Trump Wednesday night was at the heart of Thursday's controversy — insisted there was discussion and even agreement on legislation that would offer eventual citizenship to the immigrants in question. \n\"We agreed it would be the DREAM Act,\" Schumer told reporters, referring to a bipartisan bill that would allow immigrants brought here as children and now in the U.S. illegally to work their way to citizenship in as little as five years if they meet certain requirements. \nBut one person familiar with the meeting said the president had agreed not to the DREAM Act, but to narrower legislation that would make permanent the protections offered by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \nWhat was clear was that the outcome for the \"Dreamers\" themselves was still unresolved and subject to much further debate and negotiation — and that the politics of immigration, which has defeated Congress for years, remained as tricky and explosive as ever. After winning the White House on a campaign that was remarkably harsh toward immigrants and revolved around construction of an enormous wall along the entire border with Mexico, Trump's sudden pivot infuriated some of his closest allies, and seemed to contain more potential to alienate his base than any of his other unconventional moves. \n\"He was so explicit during the campaign on the issue of the border wall and border security that if he were to backtrack on that promise I don't think he'd have a single friend left in the country. Democrats aren't going to support him and he would lose the entire Republican base,\" said GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California. \"This was a core explicit and graphically clear promise he made to the American people.\" \n\"At this point, who DOESN'T want Trump impeached?\" conservative commentator Ann Coulter remarked over Twitter. \nAdministration officials quickly recognized the danger in the backlash, and the White House shifted into damage control mode, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denying a deal had been struck or the wall excluded from it. Some also wondered aloud on Thursday whether the president was aware of the minutiae of the DREAM Act legislation discussed on Wednesday, including the fact that it includes an eventual path to citizenship. \n\"We're not looking at citizenship, we're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled to view hurricane damage in Florida. \n\"But very importantly, what we want: We have to have a wall,\" Trump said. \"If we don't have a wall, we're doing nothing.\" \nDespite Trump's denial, two people briefed on Wednesday night's proceedings said that citizenship was explicitly mentioned when Democrats raised the DREAM Act. Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who was among the group dining on Chinese food (a Schumer favorite) in the White House Blue Room, spoke up to say that the bill does include a pathway to citizenship, according to the people briefed, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the private proceedings. \nAnother person familiar with the meeting said that as the president and Schumer were going back and forth, hashing out the confines of the agreement, the president kept referencing DACA, while Schumer kept talking about the DREAM Act. After Mulvaney piped in to make clear the distinction, the president signaled he understood the difference and was talking about DACA, the person said. \nExactly what Trump and Schumer agreed to is unclear. But the posture struck by Ryan and others on Capitol Hill seemed designed to protect the president from a backlash from his conservative base. Ryan energetically disputed the idea that any deal had been struck, though his argument seemed to turn largely on semantic distinctions. \n\"These were discussions not negotiations, there isn't an agreement,\" Ryan said. \"The president wasn't negotiating a deal last night. The president was talking with Democratic leaders to get their perspective. I think the president understands that he's going to have to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution.\" \nFor their part, immigrant advocates and Latino lawmakers reacted cautiously, with several saying that any celebration would be premature. Many immigrants have been consumed by worry since Trump announced last week that he was ending DACA, which has granted temporary work permits and deportation relief to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought here as minors. \nIn New York, Martin Batalla Vidal,   with his parents when he was 7, said he's taken college classes, does \"meaningful\" nursing home work and pays taxes. He spoke at a rally by civil rights groups. \nTrump gave Congress six months to come up with a solution before the protections would end, although what he would actually do absent congressional action is uncertain. Despite promising to end DACA on Day One of his administration, Trump has struggled openly with the question of what to do about this sympathetic group of young immigrants. \nTrump has appeared to enjoy his newfound luster as a bipartisan dealmaker since a disaster-and-debt deal he struck with Pelosi and Schumer last week stunned Washington and garnered a stack of positive headlines. Schumer, too, clearly relishes the dealmaking; he was caught on a live microphone on the Senate floor Thursday gleefully telling   McConnell, R-Ky.: \"He likes us! He likes me, anyway.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Catherine Lucey, Jonathan Lemire, Kevin Freking, Andrew Taylor, Alan Fram and Matthew Daly contributed. Popular in News",

      "text": "North Korea's latest missile test shows it can now reach the US territory of Guam Pyongyang has said before it is \"carefully considering\" a plan to attack Guam amid rising tensions. Close North Korea fires second ballistic missile over Japan making Tokyo's hackles rise Newsweek \nWhen North Korea launched another ballistic missile across Japan on the morning of Friday 15 September, it proved for the first time that it could reach the US territory of Guam, which Pyongyang has often threatened it would target. \nNorth Korea threatened to strike Guam in August following rising tensions sparked by an intense war of rhetoric between its leader Kim Jong-un and his US President Donald Trump. Responding to Trump's statement that any threat to the US would be met with \"fire and fury\", Pyongyang said its army was \"carefully examining\" a plan to strike Guam with \"enveloping fire\". \nThe latest missile, believed to be an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM), passed over the Japanese island of Hokkaido and landed in the Pacific Ocean. It reached an altitude of about 770km (478 miles), travelling for 3,700km. Guam, an island in the western Pacific , and which houses a US military base, is about 3,400km from North Korea – meaning it was within the range of the missile. \nIt was the second time in a month that North Korea fired a missile over Japan, amid rising tensions in the region and fears of a possible nuclear war. \nThe US military said the missile did not pose a threat to its territory of Guam. However, Japan's defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said he believed North Korea \"has Guam in mind\", AFP reported. \n\"We cannot assume North Korea's intention, but given what it has said, I think it has Guam in mind,\" he said. \nOnodera warned that \"similar actions would continue\" given the fact that the latest missile was fired in spite of a fresh round of UN sanctions against Pyongyang, agreed earlier this month in response to a nuclear test North Korea carried out 3 September. It is thought that test was of a hydrogen bomb . Map shows impact of a hypothetical nuclear blast by North Korea on the island of Guam Nukemap \nReacting to the sanctions, Pyongyang threatened to sink Japan and reduce the US to \"ashes and darkness\". The UN security council is to meet on Friday to discuss the latest move by Pyongyang. \nAlthough Tokyo said there was no danger to people, it described the latest launch as an unprecedented threat. \"If North Korea continues to walk this road, there will be no bright future. We need to get North Korea to understand that,\" Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said. ibtimes.co.uk North Korean leader Kim Jong-un reacts during a celebration for nuclear scientists and engineers who contributed to a hydrogen bomb test, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on 10 September 2017 KCNA via Reuters Everything you need to know about Guam, the tiny island North Korea wants to nuke Read more",

Picture: AP Photo/Evan Vucci \nWashington — President Donald Trump has signed a resolution condemning white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other hate groups following a white-nationalist rally in Virginia that descended into deadly violence. \nThe resolution also urged Trump and his administration to speak out against hate groups that espouse racism, anti-Semitism and white supremacy. \nThe signing comes hours after Trump revived his claim that there were \"bad dudes\" among both sides of a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, last month. \nThe president said in a statement announcing the signing that, \"As Americans, we condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms.\" \nHe has also called on Americans to \"rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together.\" \nTrump latest comments come one day after he met in private with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the Senate's lone black Republican, at the White House. \nThe two discussed the president's past remarks blaming \"many sides\" for the violence and death around a Confederate statue. \nRecounting his conversation with Scott, Trump says: \"I think especially in light of the advent of antifa, if you look at what's going on there, you know, you have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also.\" \nAssociated Press",

      "text": "By JULIE PACE and STEVE PEOPLES - Associated Press ... President Donald Trump takes a question from a member of the media on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017, after meeting with people impacted by Hurricane Irma in Florida. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) \nPosted: 3:03 a.m. Friday, September 15, 2017 WASHINGTON — \nFew issues have animated President Donald Trump's ardent supporters more than his pledge to build a wall along the nation's Southern border. Now, Trump's decision to put that promise aside — at least temporarily — while he pursues a deal with Democrats to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally may test the limits of that loyalty. \nSome avid Trump backers praised the president as a pragmatist trying to make deals with whomever he can. But others recoiled at the prospect of Trump joining forces with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on immigration, and seeming to get little in return. \n\"Many supporters of the president wonder whether our king has been captured and (White House chief of staff John) Kelly and a clique of generals and their globalist friends are now governing,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to Trump. His comments reflected the growing concern among some Trump backers about the diminished presence of nationalist advisers in the West Wing. \nAmy Kremer, who founded the group Women Vote Trump, likened the president's deal-making with Democrats to one of history's most notorious political flip-flops: President George H.W. Bush's broken campaign-trail vow that he wouldn't raise taxes. \n\"If the wall doesn't get done and he gives amnesty, he'll lose the base,\" Kremer said. \"You're going to see an absolute revolt.\" \nThe worries were sparked by Trump's startling efforts to forge consensus with Schumer and Pelosi — \"Chuck and Nancy,\" as the president has cozily referred to the Democratic duo — over the fate of nearly 800,000 people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump, Schumer and Pelosi discussed the matter at a private White House dinner Wednesday night. \nOn Thursday morning, the president — a former Democrat himself — and the minority leaders appeared largely aligned. Trump said an agreement to allow the young immigrants to stay in the country would have to include \"massive border security.\" But he pointedly said a border wall, which is staunchly opposed by Democrats, could come later. He's outlined no specific path for ultimately making that happen. \nWhile allowing young people who came to the U.S. illegally to stay in the country is broadly popular, immigration hardliners consider it amnesty. As a candidate, Trump vowed to repeal the executive action signed by President Barack Obama allowing the young people to stay. But he's struggled with the issue as president, often speaking sympathetically about the young immigrants. Earlier this month, he announced that he would rescind their protections in March, but said he wanted Congress to pass legislation protecting them from deportation. \nTrump has tested the limits of his supporters' loyalty before, often to find that they were unshaken by his policy reversals. He failed to fulfill his pledge to repeal Obama's signature health care law. He's backed off his tough talk on China, declining to label Beijing a currency manipulator. The United States is still a party to the Iran nuclear deal, despite Trump's promise to rip up the agreement. \nBut immigration, and the border wall in particular, hold special resonance with Trump supporters. Some of Trump's appeal to the white, working-class voters who formed the basis of his voting bloc stemmed from his promises to crack down on illegal immigration. At his raucous campaign rallies, voters often broke out into chants of \"build that wall.\" \nOnce in the White House, Trump's nationalist-minded advisers, particularly strategist Steve Bannon, often pressed the president on the particular importance of fulfilling his promise on the border wall. But Bannon, who kept a tally of Trump's campaign promises in his West Wing office, was pushed out this summer as part of Kelly's takeover of the White House. \nThe headlines Thursday on Breitbart News, where Bannon returned after leaving the administration, were unforgiving. One panned the president as \"Amnesty Don.\" Another said Trump got \"rolled\" by the Democrats. \nWith his poll numbers sagging, Trump has spent recent weeks alternating between being deeply worried about disappointing his base and deeply frustrated with Republican lawmakers' struggles to pass significant legislation. The GOP's failure to pass an Obamacare overhaul in particular soured Trump's view of Republican congressional leaders, according to advisers, and opened him up to the prospect of partnering with Democrats instead. \nSome of Trump's supporters praised the president for what they see as pragmatism. \n\"He's to the point he needs to get something done. The Republican Party has failed him miserably,\" said Jeff Jorgensen, the GOP chairman in western Iowa's conservative Pottawattamie County. \"Hats off to him. If you need to cross the aisle to get things done, then cross the aisle.\" \nThere's no guarantee that the common ground Trump found this week with Democrats on immigration will result in legislation. Republicans still control which legislation comes up for votes, and neither Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell nor House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared eager to sign on. The scope of the border security measures that would be included in an eventual bill could also undercut Democratic support. \nTrump, trying to tamp down criticism that he was acquiescing to his political opponents, insisted he would eventually make good on his promises to his base. \n\"Ultimately, we have to have the wall,\" he said. \"If we don't get the wall we're not doing anything.\" \n___ \nPeoples reported from New York.

      "text": "0 \nWASHINGTON: The United States Thursday called on China and Russia to take \"direct actions\" to rein in North Korea after it fired a ballistic missile over Japan into the Pacific. \"China supplies North Korea with most of its oil. Russia is the largest employer of North Korean forced labor,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. \"China and Russia must indicate their intolerance for these reckless missile launches by taking direct actions of their own.\" The launch, from near Pyongyang, came after the United Nations Security Council imposed an eighth set of sanctions on the country over its ballistic missile and atomic weapons programs. Tillerson called those fresh punitive measures \"the floor, not the ceiling, of the actions we should take. We call on all nations to take new measures against the Kim regime.\" \"These continued provocations only deepen North Korea's diplomatic and economic isolation.\" US President Donald Trump has yet to comment on the launch but according to the White House has been briefed. The UN Security Council will hold a closed-door emergency meeting Friday at 3:00 pm (1900 GMT) at the request of the United States and Japan. Tillerson's call for action came hours after the US military's regional command confirmed North Korea had fired the intermediate range ballistic missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, noting it had not posed a threat to North America. It is the second time in less than a month that North Korea launched a missile that flew over Japan. Seoul's defense ministry said the latest missile probably traveled around 3,700 kilometers and reached a maximum altitude of 770 kilometers -- further and higher than the Hwasong-12 IRBM launched at the end of August. That launch was followed by a nuclear test on September 3, its largest to date, which Pyongyang said was a hydrogen bomb small enough to fit onto a missile.

      "text": "{copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 12:57 PM PDT Sep 15, 2017 UK terror level 'critical,' manhunt on after bomb wounds 29 on London subway Share {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 12:57 PM PDT Sep 15, 2017 By Jill Lawless LONDON — \nA homemade bomb planted in a rush-hour subway car injured 29 people in London on Friday, sparking a huge manhunt for the perpetrators of what police said was the fourth terrorist attack in the British capital this year. \nUK officials have also raised the country's terrorism threat level to \"critical\" —meaning another attack is expected shortly. Advertisement \nPrime Minister Theresa May said the device “was intended to cause significant harm,” but to the relief of authorities and Londoners, the bomb — hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag — only partially exploded, sparing the city much worse carnage. \n“I would say this was a failed high-explosive device,” Chris Hunter, a former British army bomb expert, said of the blast, which caused no serious injuries. \nThe bomb went off around 8:20 a.m. as the train, carrying commuters from the suburbs — including many school children — was at Parsons Green station in the southwest of the city. \nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw “out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train,” followed by “an acrid chemical smell.” \nCommuter Lauren Hubbard said she was on the train when she heard a loud bang.“I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming toward us,” Hubbard said. She said her instinct was “just run,” and she fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend. \nChaos ensued as hundreds of people, some of them suffering burns, poured from the train, which can hold up to 800 people. \n“I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying. There were little kids clinging onto the back of me,” said another commuter, Ryan Barnett. \nPassenger Luke Walmsley said it was “like every man for himself to get down the stairs.” \n“People were just pushing,” he added. “There were nannies or mums asking where their children were.” \nPolice and health officials said 29 people were treated in London hospitals, most of them for flash burns. None of the injuries were serious or life-threatening, the emergency services said. \nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the Underground’s District Line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter (150-foot) cordon around the scene while they secured the device and launched a search for those who planted it. \nThe Metropolitan Police said hundreds of detectives, along with agents of the domestic spy agency MI5, were looking at surveillance camera footage, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. \nAmong questions they were rushing to answer: What was the device made from, and was it meant to go off when it did, in a leafy, affluent part of the city far from London’s top tourist sites? \nBritish media reported that the bomb included a timer. Lewis Herrington, a terrorism expert at Loughborough University, said that would set it apart from suicide attacks like those on the London subway in 2005 or at Manchester Arena in May, in which the attackers “all wanted to die.” \nPhotos taken inside the train showed a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag, with flames and what appeared to be wires emerging from the top. \nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that from the photos it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact. \n“They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse,” he said. \nHunter, the explosives expert, said it appeared that “there was a bang, a bit of a flash, and that would suggest that, potentially, some of the explosive detonated, the detonator detonated, but much of the explosive was effectively inert.” \nPolice and ambulances were on the scene within minutes of the blast, a testament to their experience at responding to violent attacks in London. The city has been a target for decades: from Irish Republican Army bombers, right-wing extremists and, more recently, attackers inspired by al-Qaida or the Islamic State group. \nIn its recent Inspire magazine, al-Qaida urged supporters to target trains. \nBritain has seen four other terrorist attacks this year, which killed a total of 36 people. The other attacks in London — near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London — used vehicles and knives. Similar methods have been used in attacks across Europe, including in Nice, Stockholm, Berlin and Barcelona. \nIn contrast Friday’s attack involved the “detonation of an improvised explosive device,” said Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police. \nAfter chairing a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee, the prime minister said that Britain’s official threat level from terrorism remained at “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely, and was not being raised to critical. \nThe country’s threat level was briefly raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, after the May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people. \nBritish authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since the van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. Police and MI5 say that at any given time they are running about 500 counterterrorism investigations involving 3,000 individuals. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been a “shift” in the terrorism threat, with attackers using a wide range of methods to try to inflict carnage. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, said London police needed more resources to fight the threat. Police budgets have been cut since 2010 by Britain’s Conservative government. \nThe London Underground, which handles 5 million journeys a day, has been targeted several times in the past. In July 2005, suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode. \nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode. \nU.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Friday’s attack, tweeting that it was carried out “by a loser terrorist,” and adding that “these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.” \nThe British prime minister gently rebuked the president for his tweets. \n“I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” May said.___ Gregory Katz in London and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Police officers surround a fallen supporter of conservative commentator Ben Shapiro after she was knocked to the ground during a scuffle with protesters following a speech by Shapiro on Sept. 14 at the University of California, Berkeley. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images)\n233 COMMENT EMAIL MORE BERKELEY, Calif. — A phalanx of police and a campus on virtual lockdown Thursday accomplished the University of California, Berkeley administration’s goal of allowing a conservative to speak at the famously liberal university which has become known more recently for its violent demonstrations between those with opposing viewpoints.\nOutside, hundreds of protesters were also allowed to voice their displeasure over the speech by former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro, chanting “no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.” Others held signs objecting to the university hosting Shapiro.\n“For the most part it was an orderly event, attended by respectful orderly people,” UC Police Chief Margo Bennett said. “The crowd in the street was loud, but not violent.”\nBennett said four or five people were arrested on city property, though Berkeley police tweeted later Thursday night that nine had been arrested.\n“We had a successful event tonight,” UC spokesman Dan Mogulof said, adding that the university is committed to hosting speakers like Shapiro in the future.\nStreets were closed and concrete barriers were erected in what many saw as the latest polarizing event to raise concerns about violence in the city.\nXochitl Johnson, an organizer with Refuse Fascism, a group protesting Shapiro’s speech, attacked the university for deploying police for what she said was the creation of a safe space for fascists. She said it was wrong for the school to shut down the campus to let him speak.\nShapiro was invited to speak by campus Republicans, who say the liberal university stifles the voice of conservative speakers.\nNick Handley, 18, a high school senior from Modesto, about 85 miles (135 kilometers) east of Berkeley, was among those lined up to see Shapiro. He said he tried to get other people to come with him, but they were afraid about potential violence.\n“It really is sad,” he said, referring to the heavy police presence. “This is taxpayer money. It’s terrible they have to have this because a speaker wants to share his views.”\nUC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof estimated security costs could hit $600,000 for the event. He said the school was committed to ensuring the safety of students and people attending the event, and to making it successful.\nThe city and campus have become a flashpoint this year for the country’s political divisions, drawing extremist groups from the left and right.\n“We can’t turn a blind eye to reality and to what we’ve learned from recent events on this campus and in this city and around the country,” Mogulof said.\nPolice and UC Berkeley officials were criticized last February for giving demonstrators wide latitude and standing aside as anarchists hurled Molotov cocktails at officers and caused $100,000 worth of damage during a planned speech by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. The event was canceled.\nA list of banned items Thursday included shields, masks, bandanas, poles and torches, and for the first time in two decades, the city council authorized city officers to use pepper spray to control violence.\nFour political demonstrations have turned violent in Berkeley since February, prompting officers to come up with new strategies to control rowdy and sometimes dangerous crowds.\nThursday’s event was being seen as a test run for later in the month, when Yiannopoulos plans to return to campus for what he is calling a “Free Speech Week” on campus featuring conservative commentator Ann Coulter and Steve Bannon, ex-chief strategist for President Donald Trump who has returned to Breitbart News. Campus officials say that event is not yet confirmed.\nFor his part, Shapiro opened his speech by denouncing white supremacy and small-mindedness. He urged people to sit and down and talk to people who have different political views than them rather than yelling at those who are not like them.\n“Get to know people, get to know their views. Discuss, debate,” Shapiro said. “That is what America is all about.”",

      "text": "{copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 3:57 PM EDT Sep 15, 2017 UK terror level 'critical,' manhunt on after bomb wounds 29 on London subway Share {copyShortcut} to copy Link copied! Updated: 3:57 PM EDT Sep 15, 2017 By Jill Lawless LONDON — \nA homemade bomb planted in a rush-hour subway car injured 29 people in London on Friday, sparking a huge manhunt for the perpetrators of what police said was the fourth terrorist attack in the British capital this year. \nUK officials have also raised the country's terrorism threat level to \"critical\" —meaning another attack is expected shortly. Advertisement \nPrime Minister Theresa May said the device “was intended to cause significant harm,” but to the relief of authorities and Londoners, the bomb — hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag — only partially exploded, sparing the city much worse carnage. \n“I would say this was a failed high-explosive device,” Chris Hunter, a former British army bomb expert, said of the blast, which caused no serious injuries. \nThe bomb went off around 8:20 a.m. as the train, carrying commuters from the suburbs — including many school children — was at Parsons Green station in the southwest of the city. \nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw “out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train,” followed by “an acrid chemical smell.” \nCommuter Lauren Hubbard said she was on the train when she heard a loud bang.“I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming toward us,” Hubbard said. She said her instinct was “just run,” and she fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend. \nChaos ensued as hundreds of people, some of them suffering burns, poured from the train, which can hold up to 800 people. \n“I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying. There were little kids clinging onto the back of me,” said another commuter, Ryan Barnett. \nPassenger Luke Walmsley said it was “like every man for himself to get down the stairs.” \n“People were just pushing,” he added. “There were nannies or mums asking where their children were.” \nPolice and health officials said 29 people were treated in London hospitals, most of them for flash burns. None of the injuries were serious or life-threatening, the emergency services said. \nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the Underground’s District Line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter (150-foot) cordon around the scene while they secured the device and launched a search for those who planted it. \nThe Metropolitan Police said hundreds of detectives, along with agents of the domestic spy agency MI5, were looking at surveillance camera footage, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. \nAmong questions they were rushing to answer: What was the device made from, and was it meant to go off when it did, in a leafy, affluent part of the city far from London’s top tourist sites? \nBritish media reported that the bomb included a timer. Lewis Herrington, a terrorism expert at Loughborough University, said that would set it apart from suicide attacks like those on the London subway in 2005 or at Manchester Arena in May, in which the attackers “all wanted to die.” \nPhotos taken inside the train showed a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag, with flames and what appeared to be wires emerging from the top. \nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that from the photos it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact. \n“They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse,” he said. \nHunter, the explosives expert, said it appeared that “there was a bang, a bit of a flash, and that would suggest that, potentially, some of the explosive detonated, the detonator detonated, but much of the explosive was effectively inert.” \nPolice and ambulances were on the scene within minutes of the blast, a testament to their experience at responding to violent attacks in London. The city has been a target for decades: from Irish Republican Army bombers, right-wing extremists and, more recently, attackers inspired by al-Qaida or the Islamic State group. \nIn its recent Inspire magazine, al-Qaida urged supporters to target trains. \nBritain has seen four other terrorist attacks this year, which killed a total of 36 people. The other attacks in London — near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London — used vehicles and knives. Similar methods have been used in attacks across Europe, including in Nice, Stockholm, Berlin and Barcelona. \nIn contrast Friday’s attack involved the “detonation of an improvised explosive device,” said Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police. \nAfter chairing a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee, the prime minister said that Britain’s official threat level from terrorism remained at “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely, and was not being raised to critical. \nThe country’s threat level was briefly raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, after the May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people. \nBritish authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since the van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. Police and MI5 say that at any given time they are running about 500 counterterrorism investigations involving 3,000 individuals. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been a “shift” in the terrorism threat, with attackers using a wide range of methods to try to inflict carnage. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, said London police needed more resources to fight the threat. Police budgets have been cut since 2010 by Britain’s Conservative government. \nThe London Underground, which handles 5 million journeys a day, has been targeted several times in the past. In July 2005, suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode. \nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode. \nU.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Friday’s attack, tweeting that it was carried out “by a loser terrorist,” and adding that “these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.” \nThe British prime minister gently rebuked the president for his tweets. \n“I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” May said.___ Gregory Katz in London and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.

(AP) — President Donald Trump doled out hoagies and handshakes in the sweltering Florida heat on Thursday as he took a firsthand tour of Irma’s devastation and liberally dispensed congratulatory words about the federal and state recovery effort.\nTrump, who was in and out of the state in less than three hours, got an aerial view of the water-deluged homes along Florida’s southwestern coast from his helicopter, then drove in his motorcade along streets lined with felled trees, broken traffic lights and shuttered stores on his way to a mobile home community hit hard by the storm.\nWalking along a street in Naples Estates with his wife, Melania, the president encountered piles of broken siding and soggy furniture heaped on front porches, and residents who were happy to get a presidential visit.\n“We are there for you 100 percent,” Trump said before donning gloves and helping to hand out sandwiches to local residents…\nOriginal published: 2017-09-14 14:50:43 Read the full Dallas News here \nlink: Trump Dispenses Hoagies, Handshakes In Hurricane Zone \n",

Colleges and universities nationwide are stepping up efforts to help the students who are often called \"Dreamers,\" after the Trump administration announced plans last week to end that federal program protecting immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) By: Jocelyn Gecker And Sophia Tareen The Associated Press Published on BERKELEY, Calif. — Mixed signals from Washington over a possible agreement to preserve protections for young immigrants are increasing anxiety and confusion on college campuses, where the stakes are high. Amid the uncertainty, colleges and universities are stepping up efforts to protect students enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, telling them to be hopeful but plan for the worst. Harvard University has opened a round-the-clock emergency hotline for immigrants in the program. The University of Illinois at Chicago has posted advice on what to do if federal agents show up on campus. UC Berkeley, the University of San Francisco and many other campuses are offering free legal advice to immigrant students now facing fears of deportation. Nearly sixty college and university presidents sent a letter urging congressional leaders to make the program permanent out of \"moral imperative and a national necessity.\" An estimated 350,000 of the country's nearly 800,000 DACA recipients are enrolled in school, most at colleges or universities, according to a 46-state survey this year by the advocacy group Center for American Progress. Under the program, they were protected from deportation and allowed to legally work in the United States with two-year permits. The top congressional Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, emerged from a White House dinner Wednesday to say they had reached a deal with President Donald Trump to save DACA. But amid backlash from conservative Republicans, Trump said Thursday that they were \"fairly close\" but nothing had been agreed to. It was the latest in a confusing back-and-forth on the subject that started last week when the Trump administration announced it was rescinding the program, but gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix. \"I don't think anybody can put much faith in the statement that there is a deal, because so much can change,\" said John Trasvina, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law and an immigration expert who worked in Washington under the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"I've seen tons of times when people think they have an immigration deal, and then it goes away.\" Under the Trump administration plan, those already enrolled in DACA remain covered until their two-year permits expire. If their permits expire before March, 5, 2018, they can renew them for another two years as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the program isn't accepting new applications. The University of San Francisco, which has about 80 DACA recipients, is advising students to adhere to that deadline and is raising money to help pay the $495 renewal fee. Despite reassurances from schools that they'll be able to continue attending classes, many students are anxious. They're worried about how they'll pay for school if they can't work. Ana Maciel, a 23-year-old who works full time to put herself through a University of San Francisco education Master's program, says she's been on \"an emotional roller coaster.\" She fears being deported to Mexico, the country she left at age 3, and wonders if it's smart to keep investing in school if she can't work afterward. \"Is this what I should spend my money on?\" Maciel says about her $8,000 tuition. \"Everything is up in the air.\" Trump's DACA announcement on Sept. 5 came after 10 Republican attorneys general threatened to sue in an attempt to halt the program. They were led by Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas, which has the second-highest number of DACA recipients after California. Three days after Trump announced the administration was phasing out the program, the Arizona attorney general brought a separate lawsuit that claims the state's universities cannot provide in-state tuition rates for DACA recipients. Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the schools are violating Arizona law which makes it clear in-state tuition is eligible only to those with legal immigration status. The schools are vowing to fight back. And critics of the program were swift to denounce the possibility of a deal in Congress. Numbers USA denounced the prospect of making a deal on border security to provide \"amnesty for the so called 'dreamers' to compete and take jobs from Americans and those here legally.\" Meanwhile, immigrants are fearful of being sent back to countries they don't consider home. Andrea Aguilera, a Dominican University junior in suburban Chicago, worries about being deported and separated from family members, some of whom are citizens. She was illegally brought across the Mexican border at age 4. \"You never know what can happen under this administration. We do want to feel relief. We've been fighting for something more permanent for a really long time,\" she said. \"It seems like it's a game (to political leaders). They don't realize how many peoples' lives are being affected by this.\" At UC Berkeley, Burmese-Taiwanese national Amy Lin, a 23-year-old doctoral student in the university's ethnic studies department, has set up an emergency phone tree for DACA students. She fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials might come knocking. \"The university says it doesn't allow ICE agents on campus, but that doesn't mean they won't come in,\" said Lin, who was brought to the U.S. illegally at age 12. University of California President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit last Friday that's one of several high-profile legal challenges to Trump's decision. Napolitano helped create the program in 2012 as Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama. The 10 schools in the UC system have about 4,000 students without legal permission to stay in the U.S. UC schools are among those offering student loans to DACA students, and they've directed campus police not to question or detain individuals based on their immigration status. The University of Illinois at Chicago, which has hundreds of DACA students, has posted online instructions for students and security staff to call campus police immediately if anyone, including federal agents, comes on campus and starts asking questions. \"We have to follow the law, obviously,\" said UIC Provost Susan Poser, but \"we're going to do everything we can to support (students).\" At Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, president Elizabeth Kiss plans to invite DACA students to her home to meet with an attorney. Georgia bars in-state tuition rates for students without legal immigration status. \"I have no intention of picking a fight with the Georgia Legislature,\" said Kiss. \"I also have to keep students safe and support their well-being.\" ___ Tareen contributed to this report from Chicago.

Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists. — Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 11, 2017 Donald Trump is a bigot.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday she believed the comments were a fireable offense. \n“I’m not sure if he’s aware, but I think that’s one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make, and certainly something that I think is a fireable offense by ESPN,” Sanders said during a White House press briefing, referring to the president. Advertisement \n“Jemele has a right to her personal opinions, but not to publicly share them on a platform that implies that she was in any way speaking on behalf of ESPN,” the network said. “She has acknowledged that her tweets crossed that line and has apologized for doing so.

      "text": "News North Korea fires missile over Japan in longest-ever flight People watch a TV screen showing a file footage of North Korea's missile launch, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Friday, Sept. 15, 2017. South Korea's military said North Korea fired an unidentified missile Friday from its capital Pyongyang that flew over Japan before landing in the northern Pacific Ocean. The signs read \" White House was reported and discussing on North Korea's missile.\" (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon) By Kim Tong-Hyung and Foster Klug, The Associated Press Posted: # Comments \nSEOUL, South Korea >> North Korea fired an intermediate-range missile over Japan into the northern Pacific Ocean on Friday, U.S. and South Korean militaries said, its longest-ever such flight and a clear message of defiance to its rivals. \nSince President Donald Trump threatened the North with “fire and fury” in August, Pyongyang has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, threatened to send missiles into the waters around Guam and launched two missiles of increasing range over U.S. ally Japan. It tested its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. \nThe growing frequency, power and confidence displayed by these tests seem to confirm what governments and outside experts have long feared: North Korea is closer than ever to its goal of building a military arsenal that can viably target both U.S. troops in Asia and the U.S. homeland. This, in turn, is meant to allow North Korea greater military freedom in the region by raising doubts in Seoul and Tokyo that Washington would risk the annihilation of a U.S. city to protect its Asian allies. \nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile traveled about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and reached a maximum height of 770 kilometers (478 miles). Advertisement \nNorth Korea has repeatedly vowed to continue these tests amid what it calls U.S. hostility — by which it means the presence of tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Japan and South Korea. Robust diplomacy on the issue has been stalled for years, and there’s little sign that senior officials from Pyongyang and Washington might sit down to discuss ways to slow the North’s determined march toward inclusion among the world’s nuclear weapons powers. \nFriday’s missile, which Seoul said was the 19th ballistic missile launched by North Korea this year, triggered sirens and warning messages in northern Japan but caused no apparent damage to aircraft or ships. It was the second missile fired over Japan in less than a month. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3. \nThe missile was launched from Sunan, the location of Pyongyang’s international airport and the origin of the earlier missile that flew over Japan. Analysts have speculated the new test was of the same intermediate-range missile launched in that earlier flight, the Hwasong-12. \nThat missile is linked to North Korea’s declaration that it means to contain the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, which is the home of important U.S. military assets and appears well within the Hwasong-12’s range. \nFriday’s missile test was met with the usual outrage. South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered his military to conduct a live-fire ballistic missile drill in response to the North Korean launch and instructed government officials to pursue “stern” measures to discourage Pyongyang from further provocations. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said one of the two missiles fired in the drill hit a sea target about 250 kilometers (155 miles) away, which was approximately the distance to Pyongyang’s Sunan, but the other failed in flight shortly after launch. \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis both called the North Korean launch a reckless act. \nThe U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency closed-door meeting to be held Friday afternoon in New York. Trump has not commented. \nThe North American Aerospace Defense Command and the U.S. Pacific Command said the missile posed no threat to North America or to Guam. \nSouth Korean experts have said North Korea wants to make missiles flying over Japan an accepted norm as it seeks to win more military space in a region dominated by its enemies. \nNorth Korea initially flight-tested the Hwasong-12 and the ICBM model Hwasong-14 at highly lofted angles to reduce their range and avoid neighboring countries. \nThe two launches over Japan indicate North Korea is moving toward using angles close to operational to determine whether its warheads can survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry and detonate properly. \nNorth Korea’s August launch over Japan came weeks after it threatened to fire a salvo of Hwasong-12s toward Guam and bracket the island with “enveloping” missile fire. The North’s latest launch might be an attempt to demonstrate its ability to fire a missile close to Guam, which is 3,400 kilometers (2,112 miles) away from North Korea, said Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military official who is now an analyst at Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies. \nNorth Korea has been accelerating its nuclear weapons development under leader Kim Jong Un, a third-generation dictator who has conducted four of North Korea’s six nuclear tests since taking power in 2011. The weapons are being tested at a torrid pace and include solid-fuel missiles designed to be launched from road mobile launchers or submarines and are thus less detectable beforehand. \nNorth Korea claimed its latest nuclear test was a detonation of a thermonuclear weapon built for its ICBMs, which could potentially reach deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected. \nThe U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions earlier this week over the nuclear test. They ban all textile exports and prohibit any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers — two key sources of hard currency. They also prohibit North Korea from importing all natural gas liquids and condensates, and cap Pyongyang’s imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. \nNorth Korea’s Foreign Ministry denounced the U.N. sanctions and said the North will “redouble its efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and right to existence.” \nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",

Sept. 15, 2017, at 2:52 a.m. Medicaid Strains New Mexico State Finances Share Share on StumbleUpon \nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Medicaid health care spending is expected to put an increased strain on New Mexico state finances in the coming fiscal year, even with generous federal provisions of the Obama administration left in place. \nIn documents released Thursday, the state Human Services Department that oversees Medicaid has requested an $84 million increase in general fund spending for the budget year that starts in July 2018. \nThe demands could make it more difficult for the state to sustain spending on courts, classrooms and universities. Congress may remove some of the pressure by extending support to the nationwide Children's Health Insurance Program. \nNew Mexico is on track to collect $25 million more in the coming fiscal year than it currently spends, as surging oil production pulls state government out of a budget crisis. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press .

      "text": "North Korea fires missile over Japan in longest-ever flight - CBS News 8 - San Diego, CA News Station - KFMB Channel 8 Member Center: North Korea fires missile over Japan in longest-ever flight Posted: Updated: \nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired an intermediate-range missile over Japan into the northern Pacific Ocean on Friday, U.S. and South Korean militaries said, its longest-ever such flight and a clear message of defiance to its rivals. \nSince President Donald Trump threatened the North with \"fire and fury\" in August, Pyongyang has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, threatened to send missiles into the waters around Guam and launched two missiles of increasing range over U.S. ally Japan. It tested its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. \nThe growing frequency, power and confidence displayed by these tests seem to confirm what governments and outside experts have long feared: North Korea is closer than ever to its goal of building a military arsenal that can viably target both U.S. troops in Asia and the U.S. homeland. This, in turn, is meant to allow North Korea greater military freedom in the region by raising doubts in Seoul and Tokyo that Washington would risk the annihilation of a U.S. city to protect its Asian allies. \nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile traveled about 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles) and reached a maximum height of 770 kilometers (478 miles). \nNorth Korea has repeatedly vowed to continue these tests amid what it calls U.S. hostility — by which it means the presence of tens of thousands of U.S. troops in Japan and South Korea. Robust diplomacy on the issue has been stalled for years, and there's little sign that senior officials from Pyongyang and Washington might sit down to discuss ways to slow the North's determined march toward inclusion among the world's nuclear weapons powers. \nFriday's missile, which Seoul said was the 19th ballistic missile launched by North Korea this year, triggered sirens and warning messages in northern Japan but caused no apparent damage to aircraft or ships. It was the second missile fired over Japan in less than a month. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3. \nThe missile was launched from Sunan, the location of Pyongyang's international airport and the origin of the earlier missile that flew over Japan. Analysts have speculated the new test was of the same intermediate-range missile launched in that earlier flight, the Hwasong-12. \nThat missile is linked to North Korea's declaration that it means to contain the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, which is the home of important U.S. military assets and appears well within the Hwasong-12's range. \nFriday's missile test was met with the usual outrage. South Korean President Moon Jae-in ordered his military to conduct a live-fire ballistic missile drill in response to the North Korean launch and instructed government officials to pursue \"stern\" measures to discourage Pyongyang from further provocations. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis both called the launch a reckless act. \nThe U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency closed-door meeting to be held Friday afternoon in New York. Trump has not commented. \nThe North American Aerospace Defense Command and the U.S. Pacific Command said the missile posed no threat to North America or to Guam. \nSouth Korean experts have said North Korea wants to make missiles flying over Japan an accepted norm as it seeks to win more military space in a region dominated by its enemies. \nNorth Korea initially flight-tested the Hwasong-12 and the ICBM model Hwasong-14 at highly lofted angles to reduce their range and avoid neighboring countries. \nThe two launches over Japan indicate North Korea is moving toward using angles close to operational to determine whether its warheads can survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry and detonate properly. \nNorth Korea's August launch over Japan came weeks after it threatened to fire a salvo of Hwasong-12s toward Guam and bracket the island with \"enveloping\" missile fire. The North's latest launch might be an attempt to demonstrate its ability to fire a missile close to Guam, which is 3,400 kilometers (2,112 miles) away from North Korea, said Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military official who is now an analyst at Seoul's Institute for Far Eastern Studies. \nNorth Korea has been accelerating its nuclear weapons development under leader Kim Jong Un, a third-generation dictator who has conducted four of North Korea's six nuclear tests since taking power in 2011. The weapons are being tested at a torrid pace and include solid-fuel missiles designed to be launched from road mobile launchers or submarines and are thus less detectable beforehand. \nNorth Korea claimed its latest nuclear test was a detonation of a thermonuclear weapon built for its ICBMs, which could potentially reach deep into the U.S. mainland when perfected. \nThe U.N. Security Council unanimously approved new sanctions earlier this week over the nuclear test. They ban all textile exports and prohibit any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers — two key sources of hard currency. They also prohibit North Korea from importing all natural gas liquids and condensates, and cap Pyongyang's imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. \nNorth Korea's Foreign Ministry denounced the U.N. sanctions and said the North will \"redouble its efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country's sovereignty and right to existence.\" \n___ ",

She admits personal mistakes, but also lays blame on Former FBI Director James Comey. (Sept. 8) AP\nAmazon was on the defensive end this week after receiving criticism for deleting negative reviews of Hillary Clinton's new book.\nThe online retail giant acknowledged its decision to remove one-star reviews of Clinton's memoir, What Happened, claiming they have the right to uphold reviews from legitimate customers.\n“In the case of a memoir, the subject of the book is the author and their views,” an Amazon spokesperson told Fortune . “It’s not our role to decide what a customer would view as helpful or unhelpful in making their decision. We do however have mechanisms in place to ensure that the voices of many do not drown out the voices of a few and we remove customer reviews that violate our community guidelines.”\nFor the week of Sept. 3 , What Happened is sixth on the most sold non - ficition list . As of Friday morning, Clinton's memoir had five out five stars from 609 reviews.\nReviewMeta, a website that analyzes the authenticity of Amazon reviews, said that 25% of reviewers of Clinton's book were \"suspicious,\" a designation it gives to reviewers who have only reviewed one title.\nEarlier this week, Clinton told USA TODAY's Susan Page that she is \"convinced\" there was collusion by Trump associates in the 2016 election. \"There certainly was communication and there certainly was an understanding of some sort,\" she said.\nWhat Happened , which recounts her loss to Trump, has drawn criticism and support from both the left and the right of the political aisle.\nHillary Clinton: Bernie Sanders' attacks 'paved the way' for Trump\nMore: 'New Yorker' reveals cover it would have used if Hillary had won\nExclusive: Hillary says Trump associates helped Russia meddle in election\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Hillary Clinton's post-campaign life Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Deal or no deal? 'Dreamers' wait as Trump, lawmakers joust The Canadian Press   3:17am   5:10am \nWASHINGTON — The fate of 800,000 young immigrants hung in the balance Thursday as top lawmakers, White House officials and President Donald Trump himself squabbled over whether an agreement had been struck to protect them — and if so, exactly what it was. \nIn the face of an intense backlash from conservatives inside the Capitol and out, Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP House members adamantly insisted that there was no agreement to enshrine protections for the immigrants brought to America as children and now here illegally. \nJohn Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, put it this way: There was \"a deal to make a deal.\" \nTrump himself said he was \"fairly close\" to an agreement that could protect the young \"Dreamers\" while also adding border security, as long as his long-promised wall with Mexico was also separately addressed. Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer — whose dinner with Trump Wednesday night was at the heart of the controversy — insisted there was discussion and even agreement on legislation that would offer eventual citizenship to the immigrants in question. \n\"We agreed it would be the DREAM Act,\" Schumer told reporters, referring to a bipartisan bill that would allow immigrants brought here as children and now in the U.S. illegally to work their way to citizenship in as little as five years if they meet certain requirements. \nBut one person familiar with the meeting said the president had agreed not to the DREAM Act, but to narrower legislation that would make permanent the protections offered by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. \nWhat was clear was that the outcome for the \"Dreamers\" themselves was still unresolved and subject to much further debate and negotiation — and that the politics of immigration, which has defeated Congress for years, remained as tricky and explosive as ever. After winning the White House on a campaign that was remarkably harsh toward immigrants and revolved around construction of an enormous wall along the entire border with Mexico, Trump's sudden pivot infuriated some of his closest allies, and seemed to contain more potential to alienate his base than any of his other unconventional moves. \n\"He was so explicit during the campaign on the issue of the border wall and border security that if he were to backtrack on that promise I don't think he'd have a single friend left in the country. Democrats aren't going to support him and he would lose the entire Republican base,\" said GOP Rep. Tom McClintock of California. \"This was a core explicit and graphically clear promise he made to the American people.\" \n\"At this point, who DOESN'T want Trump impeached?\" conservative commentator Ann Coulter remarked over Twitter. \nAdministration officials quickly recognized the danger in the backlash, and the White House shifted into damage control mode, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denying a deal had been struck or the wall excluded from it. Some also wondered aloud on Thursday whether the president was aware of the minutiae of the DREAM Act legislation discussed on Wednesday, including the fact that it includes an eventual path to citizenship. \n\"We're not looking at citizenship, we're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here,\" Trump told reporters as he travelled to view hurricane damage in Florida. \n\"But very importantly, what we want: We have to have a wall,\" Trump said. \"If we don't have a wall, we're doing nothing.\" \nDespite Trump's denial, two people briefed on Wednesday night's proceedings said that citizenship was explicitly mentioned when Democrats raised the DREAM Act. Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who was among the group dining on Chinese food (a Schumer favourite ) in the White House Blue Room, spoke up to say that the bill does include a pathway to citizenship, according to the people briefed, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the private proceedings. \nAnother person familiar with the meeting said that as the president and Schumer were going back and forth, hashing out the confines of the agreement, the president kept referencing DACA, while Schumer kept talking about the DREAM Act. After Mulvaney piped in to make clear the distinction, the president signalled he understood the difference and was talking about DACA, the person said. \nExactly what Trump and Schumer agreed to is unclear. But the posture struck by Ryan and others on Capitol Hill seemed designed to protect the president from a backlash from his conservative base. Ryan energetically disputed the idea that any deal had been struck, though his argument seemed to turn largely on semantic distinctions. \n\"These were discussions not negotiations, there isn't an agreement,\" Ryan said. \"The president wasn't negotiating a deal last night. The president was talking with Democratic leaders to get their perspective. I think the president understands that he's going to have to work with the congressional majorities to get any kind of legislative solution.\" \nFor their part, immigrant advocates and Latino lawmakers reacted cautiously, with several saying that any celebration would be premature. Many immigrants have been consumed by worry since Trump announced last week that he was ending DACA, which has granted temporary work permits and deportation relief to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought here as minors. \nIn New York, Martin Batalla Vidal, who came to the U.S. with his parents when he was 7, said he's taken college classes, does \"meaningful\" nursing home work and pays taxes. He spoke at a rally by civil rights groups. \nTrump gave Congress six months to come up with a solution before the protections would end, although what he would actually do absent congressional action is uncertain. Despite promising to end DACA on Day One of his administration, Trump has struggled openly with the question of what to do about this sympathetic group of young immigrants. \nTrump has appeared to enjoy his newfound lustre as a bipartisan dealmaker since a disaster-and-debt deal he struck with Pelosi and Schumer last week stunned Washington and garnered a stack of positive headlines. Schumer, too, clearly relishes the dealmaking; he was caught on a live microphone on the Senate floor Thursday gleefully telling Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.: \"He likes us! He likes me, anyway.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Catherine Lucey, Jonathan Lemire, Kevin Freking, Andrew Taylor, Alan Fram and Matthew Daly contributed. \nErica Werner And Jill Colvin, The Associated Press",

More >> President Donald Trump is reiterating his support for a plan that would curb legal immigration and shift the nation toward a system that would place an emphasis on merit and skills over family ties. More >> By JULIE PACE and STEVE PEOPLESAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Few issues have animated President Donald Trump's ardent supporters more than his pledge to build a wall along the nation's Southern border. Now, Trump's decision to put that promise aside - at least temporarily - while he pursues a deal with Democrats to protect young immigrants brought to the country illegally may test the limits of that loyalty. \nSome avid Trump backers praised the president as a pragmatist trying to make deals with whomever he can. But others recoiled at the prospect of Trump joining forces with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on immigration, and seeming to get little in return. \n\"Many supporters of the president wonder whether our king has been captured and (White House chief of staff John) Kelly and a clique of generals and their globalist friends are now governing,\" said Roger Stone, a longtime informal adviser to Trump. His comments reflected the growing concern among some Trump backers about the diminished presence of nationalist advisers in the West Wing. \nAmy Kremer, who founded the group Women Vote Trump, likened the president's deal-making with Democrats to one of history's most notorious political flip-flops: President George H.W. Bush's broken campaign-trail vow that he wouldn't raise taxes. \n\"If the wall doesn't get done and he gives amnesty, he'll lose the base,\" Kremer said. \"You're going to see an absolute revolt.\" \nThe worries were sparked by Trump's startling efforts to forge consensus with Schumer and Pelosi - \"Chuck and Nancy,\" as the president has cozily referred to the Democratic duo - over the fate of nearly 800,000 people brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump, Schumer and Pelosi discussed the matter at a private White House dinner Wednesday night. \nOn Thursday morning, the president - a former Democrat himself - and the minority leaders appeared largely aligned. Trump said an agreement to allow the young immigrants to stay in the country would have to include \"massive border security.\" But he pointedly said a border wall, which is staunchly opposed by Democrats, could come later. He's outlined no specific path for ultimately making that happen. \nWhile allowing young people who came to the U.S. illegally to stay in the country is broadly popular, immigration hardliners consider it amnesty. As a candidate, Trump vowed to repeal the executive action signed by President Barack Obama allowing the young people to stay. But he's struggled with the issue as president, often speaking sympathetically about the young immigrants. Earlier this month, he announced that he would rescind their protections in March, but said he wanted Congress to pass legislation protecting them from deportation. \nTrump has tested the limits of his supporters' loyalty before, often to find that they were unshaken by his policy reversals. He failed to fulfill his pledge to repeal Obama's signature health care law. He's backed off his tough talk on China, declining to label Beijing a currency manipulator. The United States is still a party to the Iran nuclear deal, despite Trump's promise to rip up the agreement. \nBut immigration, and the border wall in particular, hold special resonance with Trump supporters. Some of Trump's appeal to the white, working-class voters who formed the basis of his voting bloc stemmed from his promises to crack down on illegal immigration. At his raucous campaign rallies, voters often broke out into chants of \"build that wall.\" \nOnce in the White House, Trump's nationalist-minded advisers, particularly strategist Steve Bannon, often pressed the president on the particular importance of fulfilling his promise on the border wall. But Bannon, who kept a tally of Trump's campaign promises in his West Wing office, was pushed out this summer as part of Kelly's takeover of the White House. \nThe headlines Thursday on Breitbart News, where Bannon returned after leaving the administration, were unforgiving. One panned the president as \"Amnesty Don.\" Another said Trump got \"rolled\" by the Democrats. \nWith his poll numbers sagging, Trump has spent recent weeks alternating between being deeply worried about disappointing his base and deeply frustrated with Republican lawmakers' struggles to pass significant legislation. The GOP's failure to pass an Obamacare overhaul in particular soured Trump's view of Republican congressional leaders, according to advisers, and opened him up to the prospect of partnering with Democrats instead. \nSome of Trump's supporters praised the president for what they see as pragmatism. \n\"He's to the point he needs to get something done. The Republican Party has failed him miserably,\" said Jeff Jorgensen, the GOP chairman in western Iowa's conservative Pottawattamie County. \"Hats off to him. If you need to cross the aisle to get things done, then cross the aisle.\" \nThere's no guarantee that the common ground Trump found this week with Democrats on immigration will result in legislation. Republicans still control which legislation comes up for votes, and neither Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell nor House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared eager to sign on. The scope of the border security measures that would be included in an eventual bill could also undercut Democratic support. \nTrump, trying to tamp down criticism that he was acquiescing to his political opponents, insisted he would eventually make good on his promises to his base. \n\"Ultimately, we have to have the wall,\" he said. \"If we don't get the wall we're not doing anything.\" \n___ \nPeoples reported from New York.

      "text": "Schools seek to help immigrants amid mixed signals on DACA 2017-09-15T07:38:41Z By JOCELYN GECKER and SOPHIA TAREENAssociated Press \nBERKELEY, Calif. (AP) - Mixed signals from Washington over a possible agreement to preserve protections for young immigrants are increasing anxiety and confusion on college campuses, where the stakes are high. \nAmid the uncertainty, colleges and universities are stepping up efforts to protect students enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, telling them to be hopeful but plan for the worst. \nHarvard University has opened a round-the-clock emergency hotline for immigrants in the program. The University of Illinois at Chicago has posted advice on what to do if federal agents show up on campus. UC Berkeley, the University of San Francisco and many other campuses are offering free legal advice to immigrant students now facing fears of deportation. Nearly sixty college and university presidents sent a letter urging congressional leaders to make the program permanent out of \"moral imperative and a national necessity.\" \nAn estimated 350,000 of the country's nearly 800,000 DACA recipients are currently enrolled in school, most at colleges or universities, according to a 46-state survey this year by the advocacy group Center for American Progress. Under the program, they were protected from deportation and allowed to legally work in the United States with two-year permits. \nThe top congressional Democrats, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, emerged from a White House dinner Wednesday to say they had reached a deal with President Donald Trump to save DACA. But amid backlash from conservative Republicans, Trump said Thursday that they were \"fairly close\" but nothing had been agreed to. \nIt was the latest in a confusing back-and-forth on the subject that started last week when the Trump administration announced it was rescinding the program, but gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix. \n\"I don't think anybody can put much faith in the statement that there is a deal, because so much can change,\" said John Trasvina, dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law and an immigration expert who worked in Washington under the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"I've seen tons of times when people think they have an immigration deal, and then it goes away.\" \nUnder the Trump administration plan, those already enrolled in DACA remain covered until their two-year permits expire. If their permits expire before March, 5, 2018, they can renew them for another two years as long as they apply by Oct. 5. But the program isn't accepting new applications. \nThe University of San Francisco, which has about 80 DACA recipients, is advising students to adhere to that deadline and is raising money to help pay the $495 renewal fee. \nDespite reassurances from schools that they'll be able to continue attending classes, many students are anxious. They're worried about how they'll pay for school if they can't work. \nAna Maciel, a 23-year-old who works full time to put herself through a University of San Francisco education Master's program, says she's been on \"an emotional roller coaster.\" She fears being deported to Mexico, the country she left at age 3, and wonders if it's smart to keep investing in school if she can't work afterward. \n\"Is this what I should spend my money on?\" Maciel says about her $8,000 tuition. \"Everything is up in the air.\" \nTrump's DACA announcement on Sept. 5 came after 10 Republican attorneys general threatened to sue in an attempt to halt the program. They were led by Attorney General Ken Paxton in Texas, which has the second-highest number of DACA recipients after California. \nThree days after Trump announced the administration was phasing out the program, the Arizona attorney general brought a separate lawsuit that claims the state's universities cannot provide in-state tuition rates for DACA recipients. Attorney General Mark Brnovich says the schools are violating Arizona law which makes it clear in-state tuition is eligible only to those with legal immigration status. The schools are vowing to fight back. \nAnd critics of the program were swift to denounce the possibility of a deal in Congress. Numbers USA denounced the prospect of making a deal on border security to provide \"amnesty for the so called 'dreamers' to compete and take jobs from Americans and those here legally.\" \nMeanwhile, immigrants are fearful of being sent back to countries they don't consider home. \nAndrea Aguilera, a Dominican University junior in suburban Chicago, worries about being deported and separated from family members, some of whom are citizens. She was illegally brought across the Mexican border at age 4. \n\"You never know what can happen under this administration. We do want to feel relief. We've been fighting for something more permanent for a really long time,\" she said. \"It seems like it's a game (to political leaders). They don't realize how many peoples' lives are being affected by this.\" \nAt UC Berkeley, Burmese-Taiwanese national Amy Lin, a 23-year-old doctoral student in the university's ethnic studies department, has set up an emergency phone tree for DACA students. She fears Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials might come knocking. \n\"The university says it doesn't allow ICE agents on campus, but that doesn't mean they won't come in,\" said Lin, who was brought to the U.S. illegally at age 12. \nUniversity of California President Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit last Friday that's one of several high-profile legal challenges to Trump's decision. \nNapolitano helped create the program in 2012 as Homeland Security secretary under President Barack Obama. The 10 schools in the UC system have about 4,000 students without legal permission to stay in the U.S. \nUC schools are among those offering student loans to DACA students, and they've directed campus police not to question or detain individuals based on their immigration status. \nThe University of Illinois at Chicago, which has hundreds of DACA students, has posted online instructions for students and security staff to call campus police immediately if anyone, including federal agents, comes on campus and starts asking questions. \n\"We have to follow the law, obviously,\" said UIC Provost Susan Poser, but \"we're going to do everything we can to support (students).\" \nAt Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, president Elizabeth Kiss plans to invite DACA students to her home to meet with an attorney. Georgia bars in-state tuition rates for students without legal immigration status. \n\"I have no intention of picking a fight with the Georgia Legislature,\" said Kiss. \"I also have to keep students safe and support their well-being.\" \n___ \nTareen contributed to this report from Chicago.

      "text": " White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders commented on Hillary Clinton's book 'What Happened' when asked whether or not President Donald Trump will read it. USA TODAY\nEach week, USA TODAY's OnPolitics blog takes a look at how media from the left and the right reacted to a political news story, giving liberals and conservatives a peek into the other's media bubble.\nThis week, pundits from both sides of the political fence heaped criticism on Hillary Clinton's memoir What Happened, which examines her 2016 loss to President Trump. Commentators from the left and the right slammed Clinton for blaming everyone but herself for her historic defeat. But some Clinton supporters came to her defense, implying the calls for her to fade away are partly rooted in gender.\nLast week: 'Trump sold us out' say conservatives after deal with 'Chuck and Nancy'\nFrom the left: 'Hillary Clinton doesn't get it' What Happened is a \"fairy tale,\" writes Sarah Jones for the New Republic . \"The great tragedy is that Clinton seems to think it's true.\"\nJones says Clinton shows \"a fatal lack of awareness\" in her book and that she \"cannot admit that she — and her party — bear some responsibility\" for her losing \"to the most unqualified and most loathed presidential candidate in modern history.\"\nThe book, with references to partying in the Hamptons and vacationing with Oscar de la Renta, has a \"proud one percent vibe,\" Jones says. And \"Clinton seems unable to grasp that voters may have grown tired of realist politicians and their cynical pose,\" she adds.\n\"If the Democratic Party is to move left, if is to emerge from the rubble of the 2016 campaign with invigorated purpose, it has to leave Clinton behind,\" Jones concludes. \"If only she’d let it.\"\nFrom the right: Clinton names 43 problems with her campaign, but she ain't one Clinton's campaign memoir \"bears no resemblance to the truth of what happened in her losing quest for the presidency,\" writes Fox News' Greg Jarrett.\nJarrett accuses Clinton of engaging \"in what psychiatrists call 'projection' — when people persistently blame others for their own failings. They view themselves as chronic victims, refusing to accept personal responsibility for the decisions they alone make.\"\nClinton has blamed 43 causes for her defeat, according to a list compiled by Jarrett . But, \"the truth is Clinton was an uninspiring candidate who ran a flawed campaign,\" he writes.\nFrom the left: Clinton took being a hypocrite 'to a whole new level' Clinton is flagrantly guilty of hypocrisy in her \"baffling decision\" to go after Bernie Sanders in her book, writes Branko Marcetic for Jacobin . Marcetic says Clinton's conduct in her 2008 primary campaign against Barack Obama was \"inarguably far worse than anything Sanders did in 2016.\"\nClinton complained to NPR this morning that the \"consistent pounding\" she took from Sanders and his supporters \"really was hard to break out from.\" But Sanders’s criticisms of her association with Henry Kissinger and Goldman Sachs pale in comparison to the kind of gutter politics she engaged in against Obama.\nFrom the right: Clinton's 'laugh-inducing' media analysis \"Hillary Clinton continues to make a mockery of herself in her efforts to regain the spotlight,\" writes The Daily Wire 's Aaron Bandler . \"She's now claiming the media environment is skewed against the Democrats.\"\nIn a podcast Tuesday, Clinton called Fox News, Breitbart News and Infowars conservative \"propaganda channels,\" Bandler reports.\nCiting a study from the Media Research Center that network news coverage of Trump has been 91% negative, Bandler says, \"It's the Democrats who have a monopoly on the media.\"\nFox News, Breitbart, and Infowars are convenient scapegoats for Clinton, but it's abundantly clear that the media is overwhelmingly biased toward Democrats. The media is actually one major advantage the Democrats have, which is why so many on the Right have railed against media bias for years.\nThe fact that Clinton lost to Trump despite having an advantage in the media once again shows what a terrible, awful candidate she was.\nFrom the left: Clinton isn't going anywhere Clinton supporters fired back against the criticism.\n\"With the release of her new book, What Happened , Hillary has been speaking out and the uproar for her to shut up and go away from the main stream media and pundits has been infuriating,\" writes W. Island for the Huffington Post .\nIsland points out that male politicians like Sanders, Mitt Romney and John McCain were not attacked for continuing to speak out after their defeats.\nShe also blasted the media, saying \"maybe the political pundits want Hillary to go away because it reminds them of their role in helping to elect Donald Trump.\" Island argues that \"if the media had done their job in the 2016 election, instead of being the unpaid public relations firm for the Donald Trump campaign,\" Clinton would have won.\nBut it doesn’t matter what the pundits, Bernie, or Trump supporters say. There are millions of supporters still with Hillary ... So Hillary can write whatever she wants, she can give as many interviews as she wants, she can be as angry as she wants, and not smile ever again if she wants. Like it or lump it, Hillary Clinton isn’t going away, and her supporters aren’t either.\nFrom the right: Everyone is 'sick of hearing from her' What Happened shows Clinton is \"more concerned about her own desperate quest for vindication than about the Democratic Party itself,\" writes the National Review 's Katherine Timpf .\nTimpf says Clinton's claim that Sanders cost her the election is \"the perfect example of the kind of self-indulgent dead-horse-beating that’s got everyone sick of hearing from her,\" and calls it \"hilariously hypocritical.\"\n\"If Sanders’s comments really upset Clinton because she thought they damaged party unity, then she wouldn’t be going out of her way to continue the fight long after it was over,\" Timpf says.\nNow, I do understand that such a shocking, humiliating loss must be difficult to process. But if Clinton really cared about her party, then she’d find a means of catharsis other than a publicly damaging Tour of Petty that threatens to drag Democrats down even further. Her self-serving hypocrisy is clear to anyone who’s watching, and the fact that she lacks the self-awareness to see it is so Hillary it hurts.\nRead more:\nExclusive: Hillary Clinton says Trump associates helped Russia meddle in the 2016 election\nHillary Clinton suggests President Trump read her new picture book\nJimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel analyze Clinton, 'What Happened' in Best of Late Night\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Hillary Clinton's post-campaign life Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "  12:55 PM CDT Sep 15, 2017 By Jill Lawless LONDON — \nHundreds of British police embarked on a massive manhunt Friday, racing to find out who placed a homemade bomb on a packed London subway train during the morning rush hour. \nThe explosion — labeled a terrorist attack by police — wounded 29 people and ignited a panicked stampede to safety. Experts said London may have escaped far worse carnage because it appeared that the bomb only partially exploded. Advertisement \n“Clearly, this was a device that was intended to cause significant harm,” Prime Minister Theresa May said after chairing a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee. \nPolice called it a terrorist attack, the fifth in Britain this year. \nWitnesses described seeing a “wall of fire” as the bomb — hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag — went off about 8:20 a.m. while the train was at the Parsons Green station in southwest London. \nIt was not a large explosion, and British police and health officials said none of the injured was thought to be seriously hurt. \nThe Metropolitan Police force said there had been no arrests so far, but hundreds of detectives, aided by intelligence agents, were looking at surveillance camera footage of the subway, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. \nIt’s not clear whether the device was intended to explode when it did. The site of the blast was in a leafy, affluent part of the city, not near any of London’s top tourist sites. British media reported that the bomb included a timer. \nPhotos taken inside the train show a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag. Flames and what appear to be wires emerge from the top. \nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that, from photos, it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact. \n“They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse,” he said. \nPolice were first alerted when commuters reported a noise and a flash aboard the District Line train. Commuter Lauren Hubbard was on the train when she heard a loud bang. \n“I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming towards us. You just run,” said Hubbard, who fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend. \nOthers described “absolute chaos” as hundreds rushed to flee the danger. \n“I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying, there were little kids clinging onto the back of me,” said Ryan Barnett, 25. \nMark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police, said “this was a detonation of an improvised explosive device.” \nThe National Health Service says 21 people are being treated and eight others have already been discharged. The London Ambulance Service says it took 19 patients to hospitals, most with minor injuries. The others went in themselves. \nRowley said Britain’s domestic intelligence service, MI5, was helping with the investigation, which was being led by the police counter-terrorism unit. He gave no information about potential suspects, saying “It’s very much a live investigation.” \nU.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that it was another attack “by a loser terrorist,” adding that “these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.” \nThe London police force declined to comment on Trump’s suggestion that it knew about the attacker. May said it was not helpful “for anybody to speculate” on an ongoing investigation. \nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw “out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train,” followed by “an acrid chemical smell.” \nHe said many of those on board were schoolchildren, who were knocked around as the crowd surged away from the fireball. \nCommuter Richard Aylmer-Hall said he saw several people injured, apparently trampled as they fled. \n“I saw crying women. There was lots of shouting and screaming, there was a bit of a crush on the stairs going down to the streets,” he said. \nDuring rush hour, the London Underground train can hold more than 800 people. \nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter yard cordon around the scene while they secured the device. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said the city “utterly condemns the hideous individuals who attempt to use terror to harm us and destroy our way of life.” \nMay said that Britain’s official threat level from terrorism remained at “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely, and was not being raised to critical. \nThe country’s threat level was briefly raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, after a May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people. \nFriday’s attack is the fourth in London this year, after deadly vehicle attacks near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London.British authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since a van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. \nThe London Underground has been targeted several times in the past, notably in July 2005, when suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode. \nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode. \nIn its recent Inspire magazine, al-Qaida urged supporters to target trains.Separately, French counterterrorism authorities were investigating an attempted knife attack Friday on a soldier patrolling a large Paris subway interchange. \nThe knife-wielding assailant tried to attack a soldier assigned to a special military force protecting prominent sites following deadly Islamic extremist attacks. He was quickly arrested and no one was hurt.___ Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.",

Above is the cover,\" it added, referencing Favre's artwork.\nFollowing President Trump's election, The New Yorker published Bob Staake’s \"The Wall\" on its cover, an image of a brick wall, partially built, that covered the lower half of \"New\" in the magazine's name.\nAn early look at next week's cover, “The Wall,” by Bob Staake: https://t.co/f9qJvRniou pic.twitter.com/u6RQRfQsI1\n— The New Yorker (@NewYorker) November 11, 2016 \"The First\" instead appeared online this month accompanying David Remnick's article \"Hillary Clinton Looks Back In Anger.\" Remnick spoke with Clinton for his article in which she discussed the election, Trump and \"the power of sexism.\"\nEarlier this week, Clinton told USA TODAY's Susan Page that she is \"convinced\" there was collusion by Trump associates in the 2016 election. \"There certainly was communication and there certainly was an understanding of some sort,\" she said.\nHer new memoir What Happened , which recounts her loss to Trump, has drawn criticism and support from both the left and the right of the political aisle.\nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Hillary Clinton's post-campaign life Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "  12:57 PM PDT Sep 15, 2017 UK terror level 'critical,' manhunt on after bomb wounds 29 on London subway Share   12:57 PM PDT Sep 15, 2017 By Jill Lawless LONDON — \nA homemade bomb planted in a rush-hour subway car injured 29 people in London on Friday, sparking a huge manhunt for the perpetrators of what police said was the fourth terrorist attack in the British capital this year. \nUK officials have also raised the country's terrorism threat level to \"critical\" —meaning another attack is expected shortly. Advertisement \nPrime Minister Theresa May said the device “was intended to cause significant harm,” but to the relief of authorities and Londoners, the bomb — hidden in a plastic bucket inside a supermarket freezer bag — only partially exploded, sparing the city much worse carnage. \n“I would say this was a failed high-explosive device,” Chris Hunter, a former British army bomb expert, said of the blast, which caused no serious injuries. \nThe bomb went off around 8:20 a.m. as the train, carrying commuters from the suburbs — including many school children — was at Parsons Green station in the southwest of the city. \nWitness Chris Wildish told Sky News that he saw “out of the corner of my eye, a massive flash of flames that went up the side of the train,” followed by “an acrid chemical smell.” \nCommuter Lauren Hubbard said she was on the train when she heard a loud bang.“I looked around and this wall of fire was just coming toward us,” Hubbard said. She said her instinct was “just run,” and she fled the above-ground station with her boyfriend. \nChaos ensued as hundreds of people, some of them suffering burns, poured from the train, which can hold up to 800 people. \n“I ended up squashed on the staircase. People were falling over, people fainting, crying. There were little kids clinging onto the back of me,” said another commuter, Ryan Barnett. \nPassenger Luke Walmsley said it was “like every man for himself to get down the stairs.” \n“People were just pushing,” he added. “There were nannies or mums asking where their children were.” \nPolice and health officials said 29 people were treated in London hospitals, most of them for flash burns. None of the injuries were serious or life-threatening, the emergency services said. \nTrains were suspended along a stretch of the Underground’s District Line, and several homes were evacuated as police set up a 50-meter (150-foot) cordon around the scene while they secured the device and launched a search for those who planted it. \nThe Metropolitan Police said hundreds of detectives, along with agents of the domestic spy agency MI5, were looking at surveillance camera footage, carrying out forensic work and speaking to witnesses. \nAmong questions they were rushing to answer: What was the device made from, and was it meant to go off when it did, in a leafy, affluent part of the city far from London’s top tourist sites? \nBritish media reported that the bomb included a timer. Lewis Herrington, a terrorism expert at Loughborough University, said that would set it apart from suicide attacks like those on the London subway in 2005 or at Manchester Arena in May, in which the attackers “all wanted to die.” \nPhotos taken inside the train showed a white plastic bucket inside a foil-lined shopping bag, with flames and what appeared to be wires emerging from the top. \nTerrorism analyst Magnus Ranstorp of the Swedish Defense University said that from the photos it appeared the bomb did not fully detonate, as much of the device and its casing remained intact. \n“They were really lucky with this one, it could have really become much worse,” he said. \nHunter, the explosives expert, said it appeared that “there was a bang, a bit of a flash, and that would suggest that, potentially, some of the explosive detonated, the detonator detonated, but much of the explosive was effectively inert.” \nPolice and ambulances were on the scene within minutes of the blast, a testament to their experience at responding to violent attacks in London. The city has been a target for decades: from Irish Republican Army bombers, right-wing extremists and, more recently, attackers inspired by al-Qaida or the Islamic State group. \nIn its recent Inspire magazine, al-Qaida urged supporters to target trains. \nBritain has seen four other terrorist attacks this year, which killed a total of 36 people. The other attacks in London — near Parliament, on London Bridge and near a mosque in Finsbury Park in north London — used vehicles and knives. Similar methods have been used in attacks across Europe, including in Nice, Stockholm, Berlin and Barcelona. \nIn contrast Friday’s attack involved the “detonation of an improvised explosive device,” said Mark Rowley, head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police. \nAfter chairing a meeting of the government’s COBRA emergency committee, the prime minister said that Britain’s official threat level from terrorism remained at “severe,” meaning an attack is highly likely, and was not being raised to critical. \nThe country’s threat level was briefly raised to critical, meaning an attack may be imminent, after the May 22 suicide bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22 people. \nBritish authorities say they have foiled 19 plots since the middle of 2013, six of them since the van and knife attack on Westminster Bridge and Parliament in March, which killed five people. Police and MI5 say that at any given time they are running about 500 counterterrorism investigations involving 3,000 individuals. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been a “shift” in the terrorism threat, with attackers using a wide range of methods to try to inflict carnage. Khan, who belongs to the opposition Labour Party, said London police needed more resources to fight the threat. Police budgets have been cut since 2010 by Britain’s Conservative government. \nThe London Underground, which handles 5 million journeys a day, has been targeted several times in the past. In July 2005, suicide bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and themselves. Four more bombers tried a similar attack two weeks later, but their devices failed to fully explode. \nLast year Damon Smith, a student with an interest in weapons and Islamic extremism, left a knapsack filled with explosives and ball bearings on a London subway train. It failed to explode. \nU.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Friday’s attack, tweeting that it was carried out “by a loser terrorist,” and adding that “these are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.” \nThe British prime minister gently rebuked the president for his tweets. \n“I never think it’s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,” May said.___ Gregory Katz in London and Lori Hinnant in Paris contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Rex Tillerson The Bloomberg, September 13, 2017  - Secretary of State Rex is consulting U.S. allies in Europe as he seeks a way to toughen restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program a month before President Donald Trump faces a deadline to decide whether to walk away from what he’s called “the worst deal ever.”\nU.S. diplomats have approached European officials to see if they would join in demanding an extension to limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment that are set to expire in 2025 and 2030 under the nuclear accord reached in 2015, according to people familiar with the discussions. Critics say the prospect that Iran could set its nuclear centrifuges spinning again with few restrictions less than a decade from now is one of the accord’s greatest flaws. Tillerson, who has borne the brunt of Trump’s frustration for certifying the deal twice so far this year, has to make his recommendation to the president before Oct. 15, when Trump must again notify Congress whether Iran is complying with the accord.\nThe secretary of state and other top administration officials believe remaining in the deal would ultimately be better than quitting it because Iran is widely seen to be complying with the letter of the  it reached with the U.S. and five other world powers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing diplomatic efforts. https://www.mojahedin.org/newsen/58191/The-U.S.-Is-Testing-Support-for-Extending-Iran-Nuclear-Limits \n",

      "text": "# Comments \nRegarding all of the senior citizens who complain constantly in Sound Off about high school taxes and senior citizen downfalls, usually the people I see pumping 10s and 20s into a lottery machine are senior citizens. Perhaps if they would use their energy to volunteer at places like the veterans center or nursing homes maybe they wouldn’t have so much negative energy. \nI see that Hillary has written another book explaining why she lost. Doesn’t she realize that the same people in America just didn’t want her? She lost, period. \nOSR \nThe main reason Pottstown is failing is because of the crime rate. You have to get rid of that crime situation up there. \nPhoenixville \nI recently saw on a sign outside of Rita’s Water Ice in Boyertown that they raised over $17,000 for Alex’s Lemonade Stand and in 12 years they raised over $169,000. I understand they also do approximately 40 other fundraisers. Congratulations to Parrish and Brenda Stauffer and all their workers for a job well done. Advertisement \nThis is for the person who called in about looking for a golden retriever. If I were you, you should call the local SPCAs or Main Line Rescue that’s down in Kimberton. Don’t have people call you because you never know and I would definitely stay away from puppy mills and also breeders because they’re just out to make money. Good luck. I hope you find a nice dog. \nMartha get real. You talk about Kathleen Parker not being professional and bringing hatred when she writes about Trump. How about all the hatred that was spewed out when President Obama was in office? If I remember correctly even you yourself called him unprofessional names. \nClark S. Kent \nAtheism is not a religion. How can they control our judges and congressmen? Our judges and congressmen must be under the influence of the almighty dollar. That’s the only answer I can see. \nNight Light \nNow we know why Jay Miller knows so much. He’s on Facebook where everything is only the truth. I guess the Russians found out they wasted $100,000 anyway according to his comment in the Sound Off on Monday. \nPlease do not give any money to a person named Bobby. You probably all know him; he’s a scam artist. If you make any checks out make them out to an authorized church or to American Red Cross for victims in Florida and Texas. He’s a known scam artist. There’s plenty of them going around today and over charging people for their goods. Please make sure your money goes to a recognized organization. \nWe had Jay Miller using the left’s Google as his reference search and now he wants people to use Facebook. You can’t make this stuff up. Wonder how he feels about the LCDs’ (liberal crying Democrats) fake news media not showing the looting atrocities that have taken place in Florida. Had he watched Fox News he would’ve seen the scores of criminals carrying out boxes and boxes of sneakers. \nI see they’re having problems with a VA Hospital in Manchester, New Hampshire. They say there are fly-infested operation rooms when they do surgeries. I thought Trump had this all straightened out. This is according to other vets who said this happens. A bunch of hot air that Trump has it all straightened out. Tell me another one. \nJay Miller \nFor Lady Di, I did not and will not support any illegal or supposedly legals that are flooding into this country. A country can only handle a population of just so many. Also I said for you to open your eyes to the fact that Trump is a certified liar and thief just to name a few. \nFact \nNow according to news reports there’s about 10,000 people that need to be evacuated from the Florida Keys. These people had their chance to get out and they decided to stay so now the government is responsible to get them out. OK that’s fine but they should bill them for the process and as far as billing them goes put a lean on their property. Enough of this insanity. If people don’t listen they should have to pay the consequences. \nDonald Trump demeans us in the eyes of the world, puts down our country and its leaders time and again, lies about his lies but low and behold there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, Bruce’s AC on his old car now works again. Is there after all a glimmer of hope? \nFrattbak \nBill Clinton criticized Donald Trump for his “Make America Great” slogan calling it a racial dog whistle but in a speech back on Oct. 3, 1991, Bill Clinton also said we’re going to make America great again. \nSound Off is a forum to spur dialogue from residents of the communities we serve on topics of interest in those communities.
